      abstract: "This paper proposes a hallucination governance architecture characterised by five interconnected components that provide the integrated verification governance the current landscape lacks. Grounded in accountability theory, the epistemology of testimony, and information governance literature, it argues that the field should shift from hallucination detection to hallucination governance. GGP is presented as a design science instantiation of this architecture.",
