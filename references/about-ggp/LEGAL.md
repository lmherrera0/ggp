The Grounded Gate Protocol (GGP), including all associated documentation, methodologies, visual marker systems, iteration control mechanisms, and platform-specific adaptations, is the original intellectual work of Liz Magaly Herrera Jara ("the Author").

**Trademark Notice:** "Grounded Gate Protocol", "GGP", and the associated visual marker system are unregistered trademarks of Liz Magaly Herrera Jara.

Unauthorised use of these names in a manner likely to cause confusion as to the origin or endorsement of any product or service is prohibited.

### Personal Intellectual Property Declaration

This framework is the Author's personal intellectual property. It was conceived, designed, and developed independently, outside the scope of any employment relationship, using the Author's own resources and on the Author's own time. No employer, client, or third party has ownership rights, claims, or licensing authority over this work unless explicitly granted in writing by the Author.

**Evidence of Independent Creation:**

The Author declares the following development circumstances as a matter of record:

All versions of this framework were created exclusively during the Author's personal time (holiday leave periods and weekends), outside of any working hours. Detailed records of the development timeline are maintained privately by the Author and are available for verification if required in any formal proceeding.

**Resources used:** All development was conducted entirely on the Author's personal computer, using the Author's personal software licences paid from the Author's personal funds. No employer-provided equipment, software, accounts, network access, or infrastructure was used at any stage of development.

**Declaration of independence:** This framework was created as part of the Author's personal learning, research, and professional development interests. It is wholly independent of any duties, responsibilities, or obligations arising from any current or prior employment relationship. The subject matter of this framework (AI anti-hallucination methodology) does not form part of the Author's employment duties and was not commissioned, requested, or directed by any employer.

The hosting, storage, or display of this framework on any platform (including employer-provided infrastructure, cloud services, or third-party repositories) does not transfer, assign, or imply any ownership rights to the platform operator, employer, or service provider.

### Transparency Statement: AI-Assisted Creation

In the spirit of the very principles this framework promotes, full transparency is provided regarding its creation:

This framework was conceived, directed, and authored by the Author. During the development process, the Author used Anthropic's Claude AI models as an assistive tool — in the same way a writer might use a word processor, a researcher might use a search engine, or a designer might use software. The AI assisted with research synthesis and compilation, document structuring and formatting, platform-specific adaptation drafting, and technical documentation generation. All intellectual decisions, creative direction, original concepts, architectural choices, and final approval remained exclusively with the Author throughout every version.

**The following remain entirely the Author's original contributions:**

**Tier A — Core Inventions (Highest IP Value)**

1. The "Grounded Gate Protocol" concept, naming, and acronym (GGP)
2. The five-marker confidence classification system: [CONFIRMED], [GAP], [INFERENCE], [UNVERIFIED], [RISK]
3. The four-tier source classification hierarchy (Tier 1–4) and source citation metadata format
4. The anti-fatigue iteration control mechanism with structured round limits
5. The Devil's Advocate risk assessment framework and its three tests (Hostile Reader Test, Screenshot Test, CEO Test)

**Tier B — Structural Architecture & Methodologies**

6. The 3-phase GGP execution cycle (Load Rules → Load Channel + Conditionals → Create + Validate + Deliver) with 9-step creation flow and zero-skip policy
7. The 22-channel communication system with dedicated templates (Email, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, Presentations, Press Release, Academic Journal, Legal Disclaimers, and 14 others)
8. The 7-analysis template library (Use Cases, Benchmark, Gap Analysis, SWOT, Cost-Benefit, Maturity Assessment, Stakeholder Analysis)
9. The chain-of-thought reasoning gate and pre-creation compliance verification
10. The post-creation validation gate (8-point checklist with optional BVVG 3-point brand checkpoint)
11. The platform-specific implementation guides (Claude, ChatGPT, Google Gems, Copilot) with platform-adapted GGP core embedding
12. The professional etiquette framework ("The 7 Golden Rules") and prohibited language patterns database
13. The dual-mode architecture (Fast Mode with compact rules card vs. Deep Audit Mode with full reference loading)

**Tier C — Integration & Ecosystem Design**

14. The cross-compliance integration architecture between GGP and the Author's Brand Voice & Visual Gate (BVVG) system
15. The sequential skill pipeline design: Primary Research → Secondary Research → Content Creation → Editorial Publishing, with bi-directional feedback loops
16. The content atomisation framework (one research output producing 11+ derivative formats)
17. The inter-skill data handoff protocol and error recovery cascading failure protocol
18. The Hero's Journey academic narrative framework (5-act structure for research writing)
19. The 6-layer editorial review stack with severity classification and feedback loop triggers

**Tier D — Strategic Direction & Professional Application**

20. All practical application requirements derived from the Author's real-world professional experience in data governance, analytics, and AI-assisted communications
21. All strategic decisions regarding framework architecture, versioning, and evolution
22. The domain-specific verification rules for financial, statistical, and business intelligence content
23. Final review, validation, and approval of all content across all versions

The Author takes full responsibility for the intellectual direction, practical utility, and professional applicability of this framework and all associated systems.

## Plain Language Summary

To put it simply:

1. **I created this.** Liz Magaly Herrera Jara is the sole author. I used Anthropic's Claude models as an assistive tool (which I am transparent about), but all intellectual decisions, concepts, and direction are mine. This is my personal intellectual property — it belongs to me, not to any employer.

2. **It is not finished.** This is a work-in-progress based on my tested approaches, not a polished commercial product.

3. **You are responsible for checking AI outputs.** I want to help you get better results, but I cannot be responsible for what AI produces. Always validate.

4. **Let us learn together.** If you have feedback, please contact me. We all benefit from shared learning.

5. **Give credit where due.** If you use or share this, please mention my name and the framework name. Share adaptations under the same terms.

6. **Your data is yours.** This framework does not collect any personal data. Check the privacy policies of whatever AI platform you use alongside it.
