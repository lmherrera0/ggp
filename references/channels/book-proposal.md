# Book Proposal

## Goal

Pitch-ready proposal to agents and publishers demonstrating book concept, market demand, author platform, and draft execution quality. Secure publishing contract and advance for long-form narrative exploration of research or expertise.

## Success Metrics (2025-2026)

- **Agent Acquisition**: 2-3 agents committed to pitching manuscript to publishers
- **Publisher Interest**: 2+ publishers enter negotiations or request full manuscript
- **Advance**: Secure advance payment reflecting market confidence in concept
- **Timeline**: Contract signed within 6 months of agent engagement
- **Platform Growth**: Proposal submission drive builds audience to 10K+ email subscribers or social followers
- **Book Sales**: Published book sells 5K+ copies in first year (varies by category)

## Limits & Restrictions

### Technical
- **Proposal length**: 25-40 pages total
- **Components**: Overview, market analysis, competitive titles, chapter outline, author platform, 1-2 sample chapters
- **Formatting**: Double-spaced, 12pt font (Times New Roman or similar), 1-inch margins
- **Sample chapters**: 25-50 pages, polished and professional
- **Visual elements**: 2-3 sample graphics or diagrams (if relevant)
- **Author bio**: 1 page, positioning for target audience
- **Submission**: PDF format; sent to agents with query letter

### Platform/Algorithm
- **Agent ecosystem**: 200+ agents across major publishers; targeting matters (match genre/category)
- **Response timeline**: Agents respond within 6-12 weeks (often longer); persistence required
- **Multiple submissions**: Query 5-10 agents simultaneously (standard practice)
- **Rejection patterns**: 90%+ of queries receive rejections; persistence is critical
- **Publisher market**: 5 major publishers (Big Five) + 100+ mid-tier and independent publishers
- **Auction dynamics**: Multiple publisher interest creates negotiation leverage

### GGP Etiquette
- **Claims must be defensible**: "Bestselling author" or "New York Times recommended" must be verifiable
- **Platform claims transparent**: Number of email subscribers, social followers, speaking engagements must be accurate
- **Competitive differentiation**: Describe how book differs from existing titles (not just why market exists)
- **Author credentials**: Be explicit about expertise and relevant background
- **Market data**: Cite publishing industry sources (Publishers Weekly, Amazon categories, Goodreads data)
- **No false urgency**: Don't claim scarcity or artificial deadlines; agents see through manufactured pressure

[QUERY LETTER — One page, personalized per agent]

Dear [Agent Name],

I am seeking representation for my book proposal, [TITLE], a [GENRE/CATEGORY] manuscript of approximately 60,000 words. I believe it's a strong fit for your list, particularly given your recent success with [Agent's recent client book in similar category].

[Hook: Why this book, why now, why you]
Organisations spend $billions on digital transformation, yet 70% of initiatives fail. The culprit isn't technology or strategy—it's the organisational design and change management discipline required to support transformation at scale. This book provides practitioners with a diagnostic framework and toolkit for transforming organisational design to support digital capability.

[Author positioning: Why you're the right person]
I've led digital transformation initiatives at [Company scale], overseeing organisational redesign for 500+ employee organisations across [industries]. My research has been published in Harvard Business Review and MIT Sloan Management Review, and I speak regularly at [conference/event names]. I have an audience of [X] email subscribers and [Y] social media followers engaged in digital leadership.

[Market opportunity: Why this book, right now]
The digital transformation market is growing 15% annually. Companies are investing record budgets in transformation. Yet failure rates persist. Books addressing this gap (like [Competitive Title 1] and [Competitive Title 2]) continue to sell well, and there's an opening for a book that focuses specifically on organisational design (vs. technology or leadership). I estimate the addressable audience at 150K+ executives responsible for transformation initiatives in US alone.

[Manuscript readiness]
I have completed a comprehensive proposal including market analysis, competitive title review, chapter outline, and two polished sample chapters. The full manuscript can be completed within 4-5 months of contract signing.

[Closing]
Thank you for considering [TITLE]. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this project further. The full proposal is attached.

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Contact info]

[PROPOSAL DOCUMENT BEGINS]

# [TITLE]: Subtitle explaining core benefit or insight

## OVERVIEW (2-3 pages)

### Concept
[1-2 paragraphs explaining book concept, central thesis, and core argument]

Example: "This book argues that digital transformation success depends on organisational design decisions that leaders often overlook. Traditional organisation structures (functional silos, hierarchical decision-making, specialist roles) inhibit the cross-functional collaboration and rapid iteration required for digital products. The book provides a diagnostic framework for assessing whether organisational design supports or blocks digital capability. It then walks through redesign patterns used by 30+ organisations that successfully transformed."

### Why This Book, Now
[2-3 paragraphs on market timing and relevance]

Example: "Digital transformation was a 'nice to have' 5 years ago. Today it's existential. Companies face 3-5 year windows to transform or become obsolete. Speed matters. Yet most transformation initiatives take 5-10 years, creating an impossible timeline. The organisations that succeed compress timelines by addressing organisational design first (before technology spend). This insight is not widely known; even transformation consultants often miss this factor. This book fills that gap."

### Target Audience
[Specific description of primary and secondary audiences]

Example: "Primary: Chief Operating Officers and VP Transformation leading digital initiatives at enterprises ($1B+ revenue). Secondary: Chief Digital Officers and Chief Technology Officers responsible for transformation execution. Tertiary: Management consultants advising on transformation strategy. All three groups are actively buying business books; Amazon category 'Digital Transformation' sells 500+ titles with strong reviews."

### What's Different
[How this book differs from existing books in the category]

Example: "Existing books address transformation from three angles: (1) technology-focused (which vendors write); (2) leadership and change management (which human resources and leadership experts write); (3) business strategy (which strategy consultants write). This book is the first to focus specifically on the organisational design dimension. While acknowledging strategy and leadership, it places organisational structure, roles, and workflows at the centre. This fills a specific gap in the market."

## MARKET ANALYSIS (3-4 pages)

### Market Size and Growth
[Quantified market data with sources]

Example: "Digital transformation market: $2.3 trillion annually (IDC, 2024), growing 15% CAGR through 2028. Within this, organisational change and transformation services: $80B market (Gartner, 2024), growing 22% annually. Target audience (enterprises undertaking transformation): 12,000 companies globally, 4,000 in US. Average transformation budget: $8-12M per company. Average lifespan: 3-5 years. This indicates 4,000-6,000 new transformation initiates annually in US alone."

### Audience Segments and Demand
[Breakdown of demand by segment]

Example: "Segment 1 (Enterprise CTOs, CIOs): 2,000 individuals in US companies >$1B revenue. These leaders are making $50-200K book purchases per year for executive development and team alignment. Amazon best-sellers in this category (e.g., 'The Phoenix Project,' 'Team of Teams') have sold 200K+ copies.

Segment 2 (VP Transformation / Chief Digital Officers): 4,000 individuals. Transformation-focused roles emerged in last 5-10 years; this is a fast-growing segment actively seeking expertise. LinkedIn group 'Chief Digital Officers' has 50K+ members, indicating strong community.

Segment 3 (Management Consultants): 30K+ consultants at McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture, Bain, plus 100+ boutique transformation firms. These consultants use books as reference material and team reading lists. Consultant recommendations drive corporate bulk purchases.

Segment 4 (MBA Programs): Top 50 MBA programs incorporate digital transformation into curriculum. Instructors adopt books as required reading; each adoption = 50-100 unit sales per semester."

### Publishing Precedents
[Similar books that sold well, establishing market demand]

Example: "Comparable titles demonstrate strong market:
- 'The Phoenix Project' (2013): 500K+ copies sold; consistently top-10 on Amazon Operations/Strategy
- 'Team of Teams' (McChrystal, 2015): 300K+ copies; appealed to government, military, and enterprise
- 'Transformed' (Westerman & McAfee, 2019): 100K+ copies; MIT focused, strong in enterprise
- 'The Unicorn Project' (sequel to Phoenix Project, 2019): 200K+ copies

All comparable titles focus on transformation broadly. This book fills niche (organisational design focus) within proven market."

## COMPETITIVE TITLES (2-3 pages)

### Primary Competitors
[Detailed analysis of 3-5 competing titles]

Title: The Phoenix Project
Author: Gene Kim et al.
Published: 2013
Key Positioning: Transformation through DevOps and IT-Operations alignment
Strengths: Engaging narrative, practical frameworks, devoted following
Weaknesses: Focused on technology operations, not organisational design; somewhat dated (pre-cloud, pre-AI era)
How This Book Differs: While acknowledging IT as enabler, focuses on broader organisational design patterns needed to support digital product development across functions

Title: Transformed
Author: Westerman & McAfee
Published: 2019
Key Positioning: Digital transformation playbook for executives
Strengths: Academically rigorous, comprehensive, recent
Weaknesses: Broad (covers leadership, culture, technology); doesn't go deep on organisational design; targeted at large enterprises
How This Book Differs: Narrower focus (org design), deeper exploration of design patterns; includes toolkit for diagnosis and redesign

[Repeat for 3-5 most relevant competitive titles]

### Market Position
[How this book fills gaps in competitive landscape]

Example: "The competitive landscape shows three patterns: (1) Most books address transformation broadly (leadership, strategy, technology all covered shallowly). (2) Few books focus on organisational design as primary lever. (3) Existing books are either case-study narratives (engaging but not prescriptive) or frameworks-heavy (rigorous but not accessible). This book bridges: narrative-driven (stories from 30+ organisations) + prescriptive (diagnostic framework + design patterns) + accessible (written for busy executives, not academics)."

### Good Query Letter Opening

"I am seeking representation for my book proposal, 'Remote-First Organisations: How to Build Culture When Your Teams Are Distributed,' a business/management manuscript of approximately 65,000 words. I believe it's a strong fit for your list, particularly given your recent success with [Agent's recent client], which addressed [similar theme].

The shift to remote work accelerated during the pandemic, but 60% of companies have not developed sustainable practices for distributed teams. Leaders are struggling with culture, retention, and collaboration. This book provides a research-backed framework and toolkit for building remote-first organisations that outperform co-located equivalents on engagement, retention, and innovation."

---

**Why this works:**
- Personalized reference to agent's recent success
- Problem is specific (60% struggling)
- Book fills a clear gap
- Author positioning would follow

## Tactical Guidance

**Agent Targeting Strategy:**

Research agents who represent books in your category:
- Use Publishers Marketplace (industry database; requires subscription)
- Check acknowledgments sections of competing books (authors thank agents)
- Visit agency websites; look for agents with relevant client lists
- Prioritise agents who have sold to major publishers (vs. indie presses)

**Query Persistence:**

- Query 5-10 agents simultaneously (standard practice; not considered exclusive)
- If no responses after 6 weeks, send follow-up
- Expect 90%+ rejection rates; persistence is critical
- After 10 rejections, reassess: Is your positioning wrong? Does proposal need revision?
- Don't get discouraged; published authors often experienced 15-20+ rejections before landing agent

**Sample Chapter Quality:**

Sample chapters should be:
- Polished and publication-ready (not rough draft)
- Demonstrate your voice and writing quality
- Show that you can balance narrative + framework + accessibility
- Be representative of the book's tone and style
- Include one diagnostic/framework chapter (shows thinking) and one practical chapter (shows application)

**Competitive Title Strategy:**

When analyzing competitors:
- Don't dismiss them; acknowledge their strengths
- Focus on specific positioning gaps (not "my book is better")
- Show you understand the market and where you fit
- Note publication dates; show you're current with recent titles
- Mention sales success of comparable titles (validates market demand)
