# Op-Ed

## Goal

Persuasive opinion piece published in newspapers or magazines that shapes public/industry conversation around an issue, establishes author expertise, and influences policy or corporate action.

## Success Metrics (2025-2026)

- **Publication**: Accepted by tier-1 publication (newspaper op-ed section, major magazine)
- **Reach**: 500K+ impressions on publication platform within 7 days
- **Influence**: 3+ media mentions or citations of op-ed arguments; policy/business response
- **Dialogue**: 100+ comments demonstrating reader engagement with thesis
- **Opportunity**: Speaking invitations, interviews, thought leadership visibility from publication
- **Syndication**: Republished in 2-3 additional outlets

## Limits & Restrictions

### Technical
- **Word count**: 600-800 words (editors strict on limits; cut ruthlessly)
- **Structure**: Strong thesis opening, argumentation, counterargument acknowledgement, call-to-action close
- **Format**: Submitted as plain text or Word doc; single-spaced
- **Title options**: Provide 2-3 suggested titles (editors often change them)
- **No graphics**: Pure text (graphics require pre-approval)
- **Byline**: Author credentials in 1 sentence (your title + affiliation)
- **Author bio link**: 2-3 sentence biography with URL for major publications

### Platform/Algorithm
- **Editorial cycle**: 2-4 weeks from pitch to publication (faster than longer-form)
- **News pegs**: Op-eds tied to current events/news get higher priority
- **Section placement**: Op-ed sections are premium real estate; competition is intense
- **Editor preference**: Contrarian but defensible views outperform conventional takes
- **Social amplification**: Op-eds that generate debate are shared widely
- **Searchability**: Op-eds rank well in Google search for key terms; durable shelf life (unlike breaking news)

### GGP Etiquette
- **Thesis must be defensible**: "Everyone agrees..." or unsourced claims damage credibility
- **Counter-argument acknowledgement**: Fair treatment of opposing view strengthens persuasive power
- **Attribution required**: Name sources for empirical claims; don't cite "most people think"
- **No client complaints**: Never use op-ed to air corporate grievances (damages credibility)
- **Transparency on stake**: If you have financial interest in outcome, disclose it
- **Factual accuracy**: Op-eds have lower fact-check standards than news; still demand rigor

[TITLE — Provocative, clear, searchable]
Why Companies Are Failing at Digital Transformation—and How to Fix It

[SUBTITLE (optional, not always used by editors)]
The problem isn't technology. It's organisational design.

[BYLINE]
By [Your Name], [Your Title] at [Company/Organisation]

---

[OPENING — Hook + thesis (2-3 sentences)]
Seventy percent of digital transformation initiatives fail. Not because companies lack resources or strategy. Not because technology is immature. The culprit is organisational design. Companies are trying to execute digital products within organisational structures built for industrial-era manufacturing. These structures don't work.

[CONTEXT — Why this matters now (2-3 sentences)]
This becomes urgent as companies face existential pressure to transform faster. The organisations winning the transformation race have redesigned their structures. The ones losing are rearranging deck chairs—new leaders, new consultants, same organisational structure.

[EVIDENCE — Data or example supporting thesis (3-4 sentences)]
A recent study of 200 enterprises found that organisations with cross-functional product teams outperformed traditionally structured organisations on time-to-market by 40%, and on product adoption by 2-3x. The difference wasn't investment level or talent quality. It was structure. Functional silos create handoff delays and diffused accountability. Cross-functional teams eliminate both.

[WHAT'S WRONG WITH CURRENT APPROACH — Specific critique (4-5 sentences)]
Most transformation initiatives focus on two levers: technology and leadership. New CTO, new tools, new strategy. Leaders are smart and well-intentioned, but they're trying to execute 21st-century products within 20th-century organisational structures. It's like trying to fly a plane designed for trains. The structure will always push back against the new capability you're trying to build.

The problem shows up in familiar ways: Cross-team decisions taking months. Product managers frustrated by dependencies. Engineers blocked by approval delays. Talent leaving because the organisation can't move fast enough. These aren't leadership failures or bad strategy. They're structural problems.

[COUNTER-ARGUMENT — Acknowledge opposing view fairly (2-3 sentences)]
Some will argue that organisational structure matters less than execution discipline, accountability, and clear strategy. They're partly right. Structure alone won't fix bad strategy or poor leadership. But structure is the necessary foundation. Without it, good strategy still fails.

[SOLUTION — What to do about it (4-5 sentences)]
Companies need to move from functional to cross-functional product organisation. Three shifts matter:

First, move decision rights closer to customers. Decisions that now take 6 months in committee can happen in 6 days when the team has authority.

Second, staff teams for end-to-end ownership. One team owns the customer outcome, not the technical layer or the user experience layer.

Third, invest in developing generalists with depth. Most enterprises have narrow specialists (data scientist, UX designer, product manager) working separately. High-performing teams have people with broad skill sets who can collaborate across boundaries.

[CALL TO ACTION — Specific ask (2-3 sentences)]
If you're leading a transformation, ask yourself: Do I have organisational structure designed for digital products? Or am I trying to execute digital work within industrial-era structure? If it's the latter, your strategy and technology investments won't solve the problem. Fix the structure first.

[CLOSING — Reinforce thesis]
Digital transformation isn't about technology. It's about organisational capability. And capability flows from structure.

## Examples

### Good Op-Ed Opening (Full Example)

**Title:** "Why Your Company Will Never Become Agile"

**Byline:** By Sarah Chen, VP Product at [Company]

---

"Your company will never become agile. Not because you lack commitment, talent, or investment. You will fail because you're trying to run agile practices inside a waterfall organisation.

This is the transformation paradox: Companies want to build products faster and adapt to changing markets. They hire agile coaches, implement Scrum, flatten hierarchies. But the fundamental organisational structure—functional silos with centralised approval gates—remains unchanged. Agile practices are like islands of speed surrounded by an ocean of process.

I've watched 50+ organisations attempt this transformation. The ones that succeed move decision authority to product teams and reorganise around customer outcomes. The ones that fail keep decision authority at the top and layer agile rituals on top of waterfall structure.

The problem isn't effort or intelligence. It's structural misalignment. And there's a fix. But it requires uncomfortable changes."

---

**Why this works:**
- Opening is provocative but defensible (not "all companies fail")
- Specific problem identified (structural misalignment)
- Personal credibility established (I've watched 50+ orgs)
- Pattern named (islands of speed surrounded by process)
- Implies solution without fully revealing it (compels reading)

### Bad Op-Ed Opening

**Title:** "Everyone Should Be Agile Now!!!"

"Companies need to be agile! The world is changing so fast! Agile is the future! Every company I know is trying to become agile, and it's about time. If you're not agile, you're already behind.

Traditional structure is dead. Waterfall is dead. The old way of doing business is dead. We need new ways of thinking and new organisational approaches.

This article explains why agile is important and why your company should be agile."

---

**Why this fails:**
- Hyperbolic title with triple exclamation marks
- No specific thesis (just "agile is good")
- Sweeping generalisations without data
- Doesn't acknowledge why transformation is hard
- No meaningful insight
- Prescriptive without explanation (no persuasion)
- Would be rejected by editors immediately

## Tactical Guidance

**Publication Selection:**

Tier 1: Major newspapers with strong op-ed sections (high prestige, harder to place)
- Wall Street Journal
- New York Times
- Financial Times
- Washington Post

Tier 2: Industry-specific publications (easier to place, strong niche reach)
- Harvard Business Review
- MIT Sloan Management Review
- Industry journals (tech: Wired, CRN; finance: American Banker, etc.)

Tier 3: Online publications and blogs (easiest to place, good for building clips)
- Medium
- LinkedIn
- Industry blogs

Strategy: If rejected by Tier 1, submit to Tier 2. If Tier 2 rejects, pitch to Tier 3. Each rejection should include feedback to improve messaging.

**News Peg Strategy:**

Op-eds tied to current events get higher priority. Examples:
- CEO announces layoffs → Op-ed on restructuring (tying to current CEO announcements)
- Congress proposes regulation → Op-ed on regulation impacts
- Competitor announces transformation → Op-ed on transformation challenges
- Industry report releases → Op-ed reacting to findings

Best op-eds are published within 2-3 days of news peg. Plan accordingly.

**Pitch Email (to op-ed editor):**

```
Subject: Op-Ed Pitch: Why Companies Fail at Digital Transformation [Headline Length]

Dear [Editor Name],

I'm pitching an op-ed for [Publication], tying to [current news peg].

Thesis: [One sentence summarizing the argument]

Why now: [Why this is timely; connection to recent news, trend, or event]

Author platform: [Brief credibility statement; 1-2 sentences]

I've written op-eds for [previous publications if applicable]. Happy to adjust angle or length per your preferences.

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Title]
[Email/Phone]
```

**Word Count Discipline:**

Op-eds have strict word limits (600-800). Editors cut ruthlessly:

```
600-word article structure:
- Opening/hook: 75 words (3 sentences)
- Context: 100 words (4-5 sentences)
- Evidence/example: 125 words (5-6 sentences)
- What's wrong: 125 words (5 sentences)
- Counterargument: 75 words (3 sentences)
- Solution: 125 words (5 sentences)
- CTA/closing: 75 words (3 sentences)

Total: ~700 words (editors will trim to 650-750)

Strategy: Write tight from the start. Every sentence must earn its space. If you have 10 words to say, cut ruthlessly to 6. Density makes op-eds powerful.
```

**Persuasion Architecture:**

Effective op-eds follow this pattern:

1. **Hook** (Problem): Why does this matter? What's broken?
2. **Evidence** (Why I'm right): Data, example, or expert validation
3. **Pushback** (Why skeptics might disagree): Fair treatment of opposing view
4. **Solution** (What to do): Specific, actionable next steps
5. **CTA** (Call-to-action): What you want readers to do

Missing any element weakens persuasion.

**Editing Before Submission:**

Before sending to editors:
- Read aloud; cut any sentence that feels slow or unclear
- Challenge every claim: Is this verifiable? Do I have a source?
- Count words; make sure you're in the 600-800 target
- Have a colleague read and ask: "What's the main argument?" If they can't answer clearly, revise
- Check for clichés and corporate jargon; replace with specific language
