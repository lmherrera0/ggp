# Internal Docs (Memos, Reports, Status Updates)

## Goal

Confidential written documentation for internal audiences (team, executives, board) that creates institutional memory, supports decision-making, and provides accountability record without external exposure.

## Success Metrics (2025-2026)

- **Clarity Score**: Executive can make decision based on 5-min read (not requiring followup)
- **Retention**: Document is referenced 3+ times in subsequent decisions/planning
- **Archive Value**: 100% of key decisions traceable to documented rationale in reports
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: 90%+ of readers have consistent understanding of status/recommendation
- **Execution Fidelity**: Decisions documented match execution decisions made in field
- **Compliance**: 100% of required documentation completed on schedule

## Limits & Restrictions

### Technical
- **Format**: Google Docs, Word, or PDF; versioning tracked
- **Length**: Varies by document type (see templates below)
- **Distribution**: Digital only; avoid physical printing (retention/compliance)
- **File naming**: [Type]_[Subject]_[Date] (e.g., Report_Q1Strategy_Feb2025)
- **Version control**: Document history preserved; final approval date noted
- **Confidentiality marking**: Classified as Confidential/Internal/For Board Eyes Only

### Platform/Algorithm
- **Archive searchability**: Documents stored in central repository (Google Drive folder structure, SharePoint)
- **Access control**: Distribution limited to need-to-know audience; track access logs
- **Edit permissions**: Final documents are view-only; changes require approval and version bump
- **Notification**: Stakeholders notified of doc completion; deadlines tracked for responses
- **Decision velocity**: Reports tied to decision deadlines (e.g., "Board decision Feb 15")

### GGP Etiquette
- **Confidentiality**: Never export or share externally without explicit legal approval
- **Candor**: Internal docs allow frank assessment; balanced perspective still required
- **No public draft**: Draft documents never shared with external parties (even under NDA)
- **Objectivity in assessment**: Criticism is fair; personal attacks are not
- **Attribution**: Credit ideas to team members; distinguish individual from team views
- **Accuracy mandate**: Internal docs have highest fact-checking standard (higher than external)

## Examples

### Good Status Update Example

**TO:** Management Team
**FROM:** Sarah, Product Lead
**DATE:** Feb 6, 2025
**RE:** Product Development — Week of Feb 3-7

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**
Design review completed 2 days early. Prototype feedback is positive; 3 feature requests incorporated. Engineering begins Sprint 4 on schedule.

**KEY METRICS:**
Timeline: Green (on track)
Budget: $45K spent of $200K allocated (22.5%) | Burn rate: $5.2K/week
Quality gates: Design specs signed off by stakeholders (100%)

**ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**
• Completed usability testing with 12 enterprise customers
• Finalized UX specification document with engineering buy-in
• Resolved API integration architecture (deferred blocker from week 1)
• Hired 2 junior engineers (backfill for team growth)

**BLOCKERS/RISKS:**
Blocker: Legal review of ToS changes pending | Owner: Marcus (Legal) | ETA: Feb 13
Risk: Vendor dependency on [Service] — if service degrades, affects launch timeline | Mitigation: Building fallback integration; starting validation this week | Likelihood: Low

**UPCOMING:**
• Engineering begins Sprint 4 (Feb 10)
• Customer advisory board meeting (Feb 14) — will demo prototype
• Internal security review (Feb 17)

**ASK:**
Decision: Customer onboarding flow — do we support 2-step or 3-step? See attached comparison. Needed by Feb 10.
Approval: Marketing wants to announce beta access at conference (Feb 20). Need your sign-off on positioning.

---

**Why this works:**
- Executive summary is actionable (reader knows status in one sentence)
- Metrics are quantified (not "going well" but "22.5% burn, on track")
- Blockers are owned and dated (not ambiguous)
- Asks are specific with deadlines (decision by Feb 10, approval needed for announcement)
- Tone is factual, not emotional
- Balance of good news and risk transparency

### Good Recommendation Memo Example

**TO:** CEO
**FROM:** Chief Strategy Officer
**DATE:** Feb 6, 2025
**RE:** Recommendation: Strategic Partnership with [Company Name]

**SITUATION:**
We've been in discussions with [Company] about a potential partnership to co-develop integrated solutions. Their product complements ours; combined offering would reach 40% more customers. Decision needed by Feb 28 (their board approves partnerships quarterly).

**COMPLICATION:**
Upside is clear (market reach, revenue growth). But partnership requires technology integration (3-4 months), shared roadmap alignment (complex), and co-marketing commitments. Their culture is different from ours; integration risk is real.

**OPTIONS:**

Option A: Full partnership (technology integration, combined sales team, shared roadmap)
Pros: Fastest market entry, biggest upside (projected $X new ARR)
Cons: Resource-intensive integration, cultural alignment challenges, dependency on partner execution
Cost: $X investment | Timeline: 6-9 months to full integration | Risk: High

Option B: Lightweight partnership (integration only, separate sales, loose roadmap alignment)
Pros: Lower risk, maintains autonomy, can test partnership dynamics
Cons: Limited upside, slower market entry, doesn't maximise partnership value
Cost: $X investment | Timeline: 4-6 months to integration | Risk: Medium

Option C: Formal evaluation period (6-month pilot with limited integration)
Pros: Validates partnership fit before major commitment, reduces upside risk
Cons: Delays market entry, may signal hesitation to partner, partner may lose interest
Cost: $X investment | Timeline: Pilot 6 months, then decision | Risk: Medium-High

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Option B. This balances our growth objective (new market access) with organisational stability. We can move quickly (4 months to market), maintain decision-making autonomy, and evaluate the partnership before deeper commitment. If results are strong, we can escalate to Option A in 12 months.

**DECISION REQUEST:**
Please confirm approval by Feb 13 so we can communicate decision to [Company] and begin integration planning. If approved, I'll drive the partnership agreement with Legal and create 90-day integration roadmap with Product.

---

**Why this works:**
- Situation is clear (decision timeline, why it matters)
- Complication frames why this isn't obvious
- Options are parallel, with comparable metrics (cost, timeline, risk)
- Recommendation is clear and explains trade-offs
- Decision request is specific (date, next steps)
- Tone is collaborative, not pushing agenda

## Tactical Guidance

**Document Types & Cadence:**

| Type | Frequency | Owner | Audience | Approver |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|
| Status Update | Weekly/Monthly | Team lead | Immediate manager | Manager |
| Recommendation Memo | As needed | Function lead | Executive + affected stakeholders | Decision-maker |
| Quarterly Report | Quarterly | Department head | CEO + Board | Board |
| Project Post-Mortem | Project end | Project lead | Team + executives | CEO |

**Classification Guide:**

```
[CONFIDENTIAL] — Standard internal document. Shared only with need-to-know team.

[FOR INTERNAL USE] — Can be shared broadly internally (all-hands, partner teams).
  OK to reference externally (in general terms) but not share the doc itself.

[FOR BOARD EYES ONLY] — Sensitive strategy/financial. Board and select C-suite only.
  Never referenced externally; not searchable in general drive; restricted access.
```

**BLUF Discipline (Bottom Line Up Front):**

```
✗ Bad: "We've been working on this for weeks, and after looking at the data and talking to customers and reviewing our options, I think we should consider..."

✓ Good: "I recommend we extend the timeline by 2 weeks to incorporate customer feedback. This improves product fit without materially impacting Q2 launch."

Structure:
1. Recommendation/decision [one sentence]
2. Why it matters [one sentence]
3. Supporting detail [paragraphs]
```

**Confidentiality Handling:**

- Store docs in classified folder (access restricted)
- Don't email to external parties (use secure share link with expiration)
- No printing (unless board doc for in-person meeting)
- Mention externally only in vague terms: "internal assessment" not "internal sales declined 15%"
