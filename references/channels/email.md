# Email

## Goal

Clear, actionable, professionally recorded communication that creates documented accountability and reduces misunderstanding through inverted-pyramid clarity.

## Success Metrics (2025-2026)

- **Response Rate**: 85%+ within 24 hours for action emails
- **Clarity Score**: Zero "what did you mean?" follow-ups on first 50 emails per quarter
- **Documentation Value**: Email transcripts usable in retrospectives without additional explanation
- **Recipient Confidence**: Recipient acts on first read without re-reading
- **Tone Accuracy**: Tone matches context (C-Suite/Peers/Clients/Cross-cultural) per sender intent

## Limits & Restrictions

### Technical
- **Standard**: Plain text or minimal HTML formatting
- **Character limit**: None (but keep paragraphs under 100 words)
- **Attachments**: Maximum 25MB; use file links for large documents
- **Subject line**: 50 characters or fewer
- **Response time**: Flag urgent with [URGENT] prefix only when genuinely time-critical (< 4 hours)

### Platform/Algorithm
- **Inbox priority**: Short subject + first line visible in preview determines open rate
- **Reading behaviour**: Most recipients scan; don't bury critical info in paragraph 3
- **Forward risk**: High; assume email will be forwarded. Content must be defensible if read by unintended audience
- **Thread decay**: Replies after 5 exchanges become hard to follow; consider switching to meeting
- **Mobile reading**: 50%+ of reads on mobile; keep paragraphs short and scannable

### GGP Etiquette
- **Confidentiality**: Never discuss client details, pricing, or internal strategy in email (use Slack for urgent, always flag sensitivity)
- **No complaints**: Keep negative feedback constructive and private; escalate interpersonal issues offline
- **Accidental forward test**: Would you be comfortable if this was forwarded to CEO, HR, or opposing counsel?
- **Tone calibration**: Match audience (C-Suite = formal, Peers = direct, Clients = consultative, Cross-cultural = explicit)
- **Attribution**: Name your sources for claims; avoid "I've heard" or "people say"

## Template

### Action Email

```
Subject: [Tag: REQUEST/UPDATE/URGENT] Topic + deadline (50 chars max)

Hi [Name],

[ONE-SENTENCE CONTEXT]
Context: We need input on X before Y because Z.

[WHAT YOU NEED (in order of priority)]
Action Items:
1. Review draft attached (deadline: Friday EOD)
2. Confirm budget by tomorrow
3. Introduce us to contact X by next week

[WHY IT MATTERS]
Rationale: This unblocks the client review phase and keeps us on track for launch.

[NEXT STEPS]
I'll follow up Tuesday if I haven't heard back. Slack me if you have questions.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

### Informational Email

```
Subject: FYI: Topic (update, announcement)

Hi [Name],

[HEADLINE — what changed and why it matters to them]
We've completed the Phase 1 review. Key finding: adoption is 12% higher than Q4 forecast.

[CONTEXT — what led here]
Background: We ran user interviews across 40 customers in January. [See attached summary for full data.]

[IMPLICATIONS — what this means for them]
What this means: You can expect higher demand for onboarding support in Q2. I'd recommend pre-hiring 2 contractors.

[OPTIONAL: ASK]
No action needed unless you want to discuss strategy. Happy to brief you Monday.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Escalation Email

```
Subject: [ESCALATION] Issue + decision authority needed

Hi [Name],

[SITUATION]
Issue: The client has blocked approval of Phase 2 pending cost reduction of 25%.

[ATTEMPTS & CONSTRAINT]
What we've tried: We've cut scope twice; further cuts impact launch timeline and product quality.
Constraint: We need decision authority on budget or scope by Friday to communicate to client.

[OPTIONS & RECOMMENDATION]
1. Authorise budget increase (lowest risk to quality/timeline)
2. Negotiate extended timeline (client may object; costs more)
3. Cut feature X (meets cost target; degrades product)

I recommend Option 1 and would like your sign-off.

[REQUEST FOR DECISION]
Can we sync 30 min Thursday to lock this in?

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

## Examples

### Good Example

**Subject**: Approval needed: Q2 budget by Friday EOD

Hi Sarah,

We're finalizing Q2 spending. I need your approval on the discretionary budget allocation for the client success team (attached summary). The $85K increase reflects 3 new hires we discussed.

Approval needed by Friday EOD so finance can process.

Happy to discuss Tuesday if you have questions.

Thanks,
James

**Why this works:**
- Subject line is specific and deadline is clear
- First sentence tells reader what they need to do
- Paragraph is scannable (one action item stated upfront)
- Tone is respectful but direct
- No ambiguity about next steps

### Bad Example

**Subject**: Q2 stuff

Hi Sarah,

Hope you're having a good week! I wanted to touch base about something we talked about before regarding the budget for next quarter. I think we should probably increase it a bit, and I've attached a thing that explains why. Let me know what you think and if you have any questions about anything. Thanks so much!

---

**Why this fails:**
- Vague subject line; reader won't know what's inside
- No clear action (approve? discuss? read?)
- No deadline, creating ambiguity
- Overly casual tone for formal approval request
- Buries the ask in conversational language
- "Attached a thing" is imprecise

## Tactical Guidance

**Timing:**
- Send Tuesday-Thursday 9-11am for highest open rates
- Avoid Monday (inbox overwhelm) and Friday (low priority)
- Account for timezone differences; don't send 6pm local unless truly urgent

**Frequency:**
- Action emails: As needed, but batch non-urgent items (weekly digest vs. daily)
- Status updates: Weekly or per-agreement with stakeholder
- FYI emails: Max 2-3 per week to avoid noise

**Subject Line Formula:**
```
[TAG]: Specific topic + deadline/action
Examples:
- [DECISION NEEDED]: Q2 budget approval by Friday
- UPDATE: Client feedback incorporated; ready for review
- [URGENT]: Server issue requires immediate approval
```

**Tone Calibration Table**

| Audience | Formality | Greeting | Sign-off | Word Choice |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|------------|
| C-Suite | Formal | "Hi [Title Name]" | "Best regards" | "authorise," "impact," "strategic" |
| Peers | Direct | "Hi [Name]" | "Thanks" | "we," "quick," "heads up" |
| Clients | Consultative | "Dear [Name]" | "Best" | "recommend," "partnership," "outcomes" |
| Cross-cultural | Explicit | Full name, title | Full sign-off | Avoid idiom, define jargon |

**Accidental Forward Test:**
Before hitting send, imagine this email forwarded to: (1) your CEO, (2) the client, (3) HR, (4) the person you're complaining about. If any version creates discomfort, revise.

## Pre-Publication Checklist

- [ ] Subject line is specific and under 50 characters
- [ ] First paragraph states the ask or headline upfront (inverted pyramid)

- [ ] Tone matches audience (C-Suite/Peer/Client/Cross-cultural — see table above)
- [ ] Email passes accidental forward test (comfortable if forwarded to CEO, HR, opposing counsel)
- [ ] Deadline is explicit (if applicable): "by Friday EOD" not "soon"
- [ ] Action items are numbered and prioritised
- [ ] No client confidential details, pricing, or strategy shared
- [ ] No complaints about people or vendors (redirect to private conversation if needed)
- [ ] GGP markers check: Does every factual claim have a verifiable source? Are estimates transparent about methodology?
- [ ] Response time is accurate (not marking as urgent unless truly < 4 hours)
