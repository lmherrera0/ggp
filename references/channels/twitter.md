# Twitter/X

## Goal

Real-time, concise commentary on industry trends and research announcements that establishes subject-matter expertise and invites substantive engagement from niche specialist audiences.

## Success Metrics (2025-2026)

- **Engagement Rate**: 1-3% (retweets, likes, replies) within 24 hours
- **Specialist Interaction**: 30%+ of replies from tier-1 experts in your field
- **Retweet Ratio**: 3:1 retweets-to-likes (signal of credibility, not ego metrics)
- **Thread Performance**: Threads average 2x engagement of single tweets
- **DM Mentions**: 1-2 substantive DM inquiries per month from tweets

## Limits & Restrictions

### Technical
- **Character limit**: 280 characters
- **Threads**: Unlimited length when chained; use 3-5 tweets maximum per thread
- **Links**: Shorten with t.co (automatic); count as 23 characters
- **Images**: 4 images max per tweet; 16:9 or 1:1 aspect ratio
- **Video**: Up to 2 minutes 20 seconds; auto-plays with sound off (add captions)
- **Hashtags**: 1-3 per tweet (Twitter rewards hashtag restraint vs. LinkedIn)

### Platform/Algorithm
- **Recency**: Twitter is live; old tweets die fast (peak engagement 0-4 hours)
- **Conversation metric**: Replies > retweets > likes in algorithm priority
- **Thread engagement**: Reads decay by tweet in thread; put key insight in first tweet
- **Quote tweets**: Retweets with commentary outperform silent retweets
- **Timing**: Peak US activity 8-10am ET and 5-6pm ET, Monday-Thursday
- **Search visibility**: Hashtags and @mentions improve discoverability
- **Trending hijack**: Avoid riding trending topics if unrelated (appears opportunistic)

### GGP Etiquette
- **No hot takes about clients**: Ever. Use general examples only
- **No competitor attacks**: Criticism about alternatives is fine; attacks on founders is not
- **No unverified claims**: Twitter rewards speed, but GGP requires source before publishing
- **Attribution required**: If quoting research, link the paper or mention the researcher
- **Disagreement protocol**: Challenges to your view should be replied to, not blocked
- **No astroturfing**: Don't create fake accounts to amplify your tweets
- **Correction norm**: If corrected, acknowledge and fix; pin correction to thread if needed

## Template

```
[PRIMARY OBSERVATION or INSIGHT — one clear point]
The biggest productivity killer isn't distraction. It's unclear decision rights.

[SUPPORTING EVIDENCE or PATTERN]
Teams spend 40% of meeting time asking "who decides this?" not debating the actual decision.

[IMPLICATION or REFRAME]
Fix decision rights before you fix your process.

#OrganizationDesign
```

### Thread Example

```
Tweet 1:
[HOOK — something counterintuitive]
Most "digital transformation" projects fail because they start with technology instead of capability. Here's what I've learned from 30+ transformations.

Tweet 2:
[PATTERN]
The highest-success companies start with: What new customer capabilities do we want? Then: What organisation design supports that? Finally: What tech enables it?

Tweet 3:
[EVIDENCE or EXAMPLE]
Company A prioritised tech first: spent $40M, adoption 12%, ROI near zero.
Company B prioritised capability: spent $8M, adoption 78%, 3x revenue lift.

Same industry. Different starting point.

Tweet 4:
[ACTIONABLE TAKEAWAY]
If you're planning a transformation, ask first: What new work will people do? Then design around that.

#DigitalTransformation #OrganizationDesign
```

## Examples

### Good Example

**Tweet:**

"We reviewed 50 post-mortem reports from failed implementations. One variable predicted success better than budget or timeline: the sponsor spent 20+ hours in the work, not just the approval.

Sponsorship isn't a title. It's presence."

---

**Why this works:**
- Specific data point (50 reports, one variable)
- Counterintuitive insight (sponsor presence > budget)
- Actionable (not abstract)
- Invitation to reflection, not engagement bait
- Relevant to operations/leadership professionals
- Verifiable (author could cite which reports, with permission)

### Bad Example

**Tweet:**

"SHOCKING: Nobody knows how to run projects anymore!! 🚨🚨 Companies are losing MILLIONS because leaders don't care. This is why everyone's digital transformation fails. Like and retweet if you agree. DM me for my FREE guide 😱"

---

**Why this fails:**
- Hyperbolic claim without evidence ("SHOCKING," "MILLIONS")
- Engagement bait ("like and retweet if you agree")
- Cynical tone ("leaders don't care") without grounding
- Obvious selling (free guide that's probably a lead-gen trap)
- No substance; outrage instead of insight
- Multiple emojis signal low credibility
- Sweeping generalisation without nuance

## Tactical Guidance

**Tweet Frequency:**
- 3-5 tweets per week maximum (quality matters far more than frequency)
- Batch tweeting reduces visibility; space out across days
- Avoid tweeting outside your expertise area (dilutes authority)

**Thread Strategy:**
- Threads should have ONE thesis; break into 3-5 logical parts
- Each tweet should stand alone if read separately
- Put action item or key insight in final tweet (maximize value for readers)
- Use Twitter's thread feature (don't manually number "1/5, 2/5")

**Claim Verification:**
- If citing data, link to source immediately (first tweet for threads)
- If paraphrasing research, mention researcher/institution name
- If generalising from experience, frame as "In my work..." or "I've observed..."
- Use [VERIFIED], [ESTIMATED], [INFERENCE] tags if helpful for clarity

**Character Economy:**
```
≈ 240 usable characters after accounting for links and metrics

Tight examples:
"Process doesn't fix culture. Culture fixes process." [4 words, 46 chars]

Bad example:
"Have you ever thought about how amazing culture is and how it impacts literally everything in your organisation because it determines behaviour?" [138 chars of waffle]
```

**Engagement Protocol:**
- Reply to substantive replies within 24 hours (even brief acknowledgment)
- Quote-tweet if disagreement is substantive and worth educating followers
- Ignore hot-take opportunism and pile-ons (don't feed drama)
- Thank people who share your threads (builds community goodwill)

## Pre-Publication Checklist

- [ ] Single clear idea per tweet (or per first tweet if thread)
- [ ] No character filler; every word earns its space
- [ ] All numerical claims have source linked or attributed
- [ ] Claim distinguishes between [VERIFIED] observation and [INFERENCE] or [ESTIMATED]
- [ ] No client names or confidential client data (use general examples)
- [ ] No attacks on competitors, vendors, or individuals (criticism of ideas is fine)
- [ ] No engagement bait ("like if you agree," "retweet this")
- [ ] Tone is confident but not arrogant; opens dialogue, doesn't close it
- [ ] Links are verified and working (especially research links)
- [ ] Ready to engage: Willing to reply to substantive challenges within 24 hours
- [ ] GGP markers check: Is every factual claim sourced? Are estimates transparent?
- [ ] Thread (if applicable) has clear thesis and logical flow across tweets
