# Instagram

## Goal

Visual storytelling that humanises professional brand, showcases team culture, and documents speaking engagements or thought leadership moments for a younger, more visual-oriented professional audience.

## Success Metrics (2025-2026)

- **Engagement Rate**: 2-4% on posts (likes, saves, shares) within 7 days
- **Save Rate**: 15%+ of engagements are saves (indicates value, not just vanity)
- **Story Swipe-Ups**: 5%+ swipe-through rate on links (high intent)
- **Profile Traffic**: 50+ profile visits per post within first week
- **Follower Growth**: 3-5% monthly growth from organic engagement (not purchases)
- **Caption Depth**: 30%+ of followers read full caption (tested via analytics)

## Limits & Restrictions

### Technical
- **Image resolution**: 1080x1350px for feed posts (portrait), 1080x1080px for squares
- **Carousel**: Up to 10 images per post; 1080x1350px each
- **Reels**: Up to 90 seconds; 1080x1920px ideal; 3-5 second hook required
- **Video**: Auto-plays on mute; captions required for comprehension
- **Hashtags**: 8-15 optimal (30 max, but diminishing returns); avoid more than 5 on first line
- **Alt text**: Required for accessibility; describe image content clearly
- **File size**: Under 8MB for optimal loading

### Platform/Algorithm
- **Video dominance**: Reels get 3x reach vs. static posts
- **Carousel engagement**: Swipeable posts get 2x engagement vs. single image
- **Save behaviour**: Saved posts increase creator visibility by 4x vs. likes
- **Hashtag strategy**: Smaller, niche hashtags (10K-100K posts) outperform mega hashtags (1M+)
- **Discovery**: Discoverability drops 60% after 7 days; front-load engagement
- **Story stickiness**: Stories expire in 24 hours but increase daily profile visits
- **Peak times**: Tuesday-Thursday 11am-2pm or 6-8pm (audience dependent)

### GGP Etiquette
- **Privacy first**: Never post team member photos without consent; ask permission in writing
- **No complaints**: Client frustrations, failed projects, vendor drama stay private
- **Authenticity**: Avoid over-curation; real team moments outperform staged content
- **Attribution**: Credit photographers, guest speakers, team members in captions
- **Professional tone**: Fun and human, but not frivolous; maintain expert credibility
- **No unsourced claims**: Even Instagram captions need citations if making business claims

## Template

```
[IMAGE 1 — Strong visual hook: event, product, team, or concept visualization]

[CAPTION]
[HOOK LINE — Why this moment matters]
"We just wrapped the Q1 strategy sprint with our team, and one insight keeps coming up..."

[CONTEXT — What's happening in image]
This is our war room on day 2, when we realised our original assumption was incomplete.

[INSIGHT — What you learned or observed]
Here's what we discovered: The best teams don't start with answers. They start by questioning their assumptions.

[CALL TO ACTION — Invite reflection or conversation]
What's one assumption in your work that you've been meaning to test?

[HASHTAGS — Placed at end, niche + broader mix]
#StrategyWork #TeamDevelopment #LeadershipInsights
```

### Carousel Example

```
Slide 1: Speaking at [event]
Caption: "Why we talk about organisational resilience" [hook]

Slide 2: Data slide
Caption: "78% of organisations say they're 'resilient'..." [insight]

Slide 3: Key framework
Caption: "But resilience has three dimensions..." [education]

Slide 4: Team moment
Caption: "Grateful to [team member] for pushing this research forward" [credit]

Slide 5: Audience reaction
Caption: "The conversation after? Even better than the talk." [reflection]

CTA + hashtags on final slide
```

## Examples

### Good Example

**Image**: Team members in discussion around a whiteboard, mid-brainstorm

**Caption**:

"This is what a real strategy conversation looks like: lots of disagreement, notebooks full of crossed-out ideas, and someone always asking 'but why.'

No one's in PowerPoint mode. No one's worried about sounding perfect. Everyone's digging into the actual problem.

The best ideas came from the arguments in the lower-left corner of this photo.

How does your team create space for real disagreement?"

Hashtags: #TeamCulture #StrategyWork #Leadership

---

**Why this works:**
- Image shows authentic moment (not staged)
- Caption explains what makes the moment valuable (disagreement as strength)
- Specific detail ("notebooks full of crossed-out ideas") is memorable
- Invitation for reflection, not metrics-chasing
- Credits team implicitly (collaborative moment)
- Tone is confident but humble
- Hashtags are niche and relevant

### Bad Example

**Image**: Perfect team photo, everyone smiling at camera

**Caption**:

"So blessed to work with an AMAZING team!! 🙏💪 We're literally crushing it every single day. Best company ever. Like if you have a great team too! 😍 DM me if you want to join us. We're hiring!"

Hashtags: #TeamGoals #Success #Amazing #WeAreAwesome #Blessed #TechLife #Leadership #Winning

---

**Why this fails:**
- Staged photo with forced smiles
- Empty corporate language ("crushing it," "blessed")
- Engagement bait ("like if you have a great team")
- Obvious recruiting pitch camouflaged as culture post
- Too many generic hashtags (dilutes reach)
- No actual insight about team or culture
- Tone is performative, not authentic
- Excessive emojis reduce credibility

## Tactical Guidance

**Content Calendar:**
- 3-5 posts per week (mix of static posts and reels)
- Weekly story series (same day/time) creates habit
- Batch content creation (reduce burnout, improve consistency)
- Seasonal themes (Q1 strategy, year-end reflections, team anniversaries)

**Reel Best Practices:**
- First 3 seconds must hook viewer (prevents scroll-away)
- Text overlay for captions (many watch muted)
- 15-30 second sweet spot (short enough to watch twice)
- Content ideas: quick tips, behind-the-scenes, event highlights, research findings
- Audio: Use trending audio sparingly (dates content fast); trending music OK for evergreen reels

**Carousel Strategy:**
- Start with strongest image (determines click-through)
- Each slide should work standalone and as part of narrative
- Use text overlays on complex slides (multi-column data charts, key points)
- End with CTA or reflection prompt
- Swipeable content encourages exploration and increases engagement

**Hashtag Strategy:**
```
Mix hashtag sizes:
• 3-5 niche hashtags (10K-100K posts) — your core audience
• 3-5 mid-size hashtags (100K-500K) — broader reach
• 2-5 larger hashtags (500K+) — discovery hope (low conversion)

Example mix for strategy/org design content:
#StrategyWork #OrganizationDesign #Leadership [niche]
#BusinessInsights #TeamLeadership #Transformation [mid]
#Management #Professional [broader]

Avoid hashtags with 1M+ posts (buried instantly)
```

**Caption Architecture:**
```
Hook: First 2 lines visible before "more" — must be compelling
Context: 1-2 sentences explaining the image
Insight: What you learned or want to share
CTA: Invite reflection, not vanity metrics
Hashtags: End of caption, max 15
```

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Alt text required for all images (describe what viewers see)
- Captions required on video (platform auto-generates; review for accuracy)
- Contrast ratios matter; use high-contrast text overlays
- Audio descriptions for complex visual content

## Pre-Publication Checklist

- [ ] Caption tells a story, not just lists facts
