# Presentations

## Goal

Structured narrative delivered via slides that educates, persuades, or aligns audiences. Establish credibility, influence decisions, and create memorable takeaways for conference talks, client pitches, or internal briefings.

## Success Metrics (2025-2026)

- **Engagement**: 90%+ of audience remains attentive (not scrolling phones)
- **Comprehension**: Post-presentation survey shows 85%+ audience understood main thesis
- **Action**: Pitch presentations convert 30%+ to follow-on conversations or decisions
- **Feedback**: Audience ratings 4+/5 on "clarity and usefulness" dimension
- **Reach**: Conference talk video reaches 50K+ views if recorded
- **Influence**: Presentation shapes internal decision or external media coverage

## Limits & Restrictions

### Technical
- **Slide count**: 15-20 slides for 30-min talk (1-2 min per slide pacing)
- **Text per slide**: Max 40 words; one message per slide
- **Font size**: 44pt minimum for readability at distance
- **Visuals**: Max 1 chart or image per slide; high quality
- **Deck file**: PDF preferred (universal; no compatibility issues)
- **Animations**: Avoid (distracting); if used, minimal and purposeful
- **Speaker notes**: Detailed notes (100-200 words) for each slide; separate from slide text

### Platform/Algorithm
- **Attention curve**: Opening and closing are highest engagement; middle sags (structure matters)
- **Visual dominance**: Audience retains 50% of message from visuals; 10% from words alone
- **Change fatigue**: Changing topics every 1-2 slides keeps attention; 5+ slides on same topic loses audience
- **Interaction**: Live polls, Q&A sections boost engagement; passive talks lose energy
- **Recording dynamics**: Recorded talks require tighter pacing (live audience is more forgiving)
- **Deck searchability**: If deck is shared post-talk, title slide keywords determine findability

### GGP Etiquette
- **Data integrity**: All charts, metrics, and claims must be accurately represented (manipulation is visible)
- **Source attribution**: Data sources noted on slides (small text ok; must be present)
- **Speaker authority**: Speak to your expertise; don't overstate knowledge
- **Confidentiality**: Never mention client names, pricing, or internal strategy
- **Slide clarity**: Slides must be understandable independently (often shared post-talk without speaker context)
- **Counterargument fairness**: If presenting contested positions, acknowledge valid alternatives

### Structure: Situation-Complication-Resolution (SCR)

This is consulting-style structure; works across contexts (pitches, internal briefings, conference talks).

```
[SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE]
[Large, clean title]
[Subtitle with key question or insight]
[Your name, title, organisation]
[Contact: email or LinkedIn]

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"Thank you for having me. Today I want to explore a question most of you probably face: [Open with question related to your topic]. The answer is counterintuitive, and I'll show you evidence. By the end of this talk, you should be able to [CTA: what they can do with this insight]."

---

[SLIDE 2: AGENDA — Optional but helpful for longer presentations]
[3-4 topics covering]
"We'll cover three things: first, the scope of the challenge. Second, why current approaches fall short. Third, a specific pattern you can apply. Questions at the end."

---

[SLIDE 3: THE SITUATION — Context and scope]
[Visual: Photo, chart, or headline representing the problem]
"Organisations are under pressure to transform digitally. 80% say digital transformation is critical. Yet 70% of initiatives fail to achieve objectives."

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"Everyone in this room is dealing with this pressure. Digital transformation isn't optional anymore. Yet most transformations don't deliver the returns companies expect. Why? That's what we're here to explore today."

---

[SLIDE 4: THE COMPLICATION — Why situation is complex/hard]
[Visual: Chart showing multiple factors or constraint]
"Transformation is hard because it's not just about technology. Three factors matter equally: strategy, organisational design, and technology. Most companies underinvest in organisational design."

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"You might think the challenge is technology. It's not. We have great technology. The challenge is organisational. Companies are trying to execute digital products in organisational structures built for industrial manufacturing. That's like trying to run a marathon in snow boots."

---

[SLIDE 5: THE RESOLUTION — What to do about it]
[Visual: Simple framework showing the solution]
"Success requires three moves: (1) Restructure around product outcomes, not functions. (2) Distribute decision authority to teams. (3) Invest in cross-functional skills."

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"Here's what successful companies do differently. First, they organise around the customer outcome they're trying to achieve, not around functions. This sounds simple, but it's a fundamental restructuring. Second, decision authority moves from committee to team. This reduces decision latency from months to weeks. Third, they invest in people who can span boundaries—people who understand product, technology, and business."

---

[SLIDE 6: EVIDENCE — Data supporting resolution]
[Visual: Chart showing the impact]
"Organisations with cross-functional product teams show: 40% faster time-to-market, 2x higher feature adoption, 25% better employee retention."

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"This isn't theory. We studied 200 organisations over three years. The ones that made these three moves outperformed peers significantly. 40% faster to market. That translates to competitive advantage. 2x higher adoption. That's the difference between success and failure. And retention matters—transformation is hard; you need your best people to see it through."

---

[SLIDE 7: PATTERN 1 — First element of solution with example]
[Visual: Diagram of pattern OR photo of implementation]
"Pattern 1: Cross-Functional Product Teams
- One team owns customer outcome end-to-end
- Includes product, design, engineering, data roles
- Located co-located or virtually synchronised
- Decision authority resides with the team"

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"Let's dig into how this works. Imagine you want to ship a new feature. In traditional organisations, this requires coordination across functions: product asks engineering, engineering coordinates with data, design is separate, QA is downstream. By the time all stakeholders align, six months have passed.

In cross-functional teams, all stakeholders are in one team. Same feature? Decision happens in one meeting. Execution is coordinated internally. Time to market drops from 6 months to 6 weeks."

---

[SLIDE 8: PATTERN 1 CASE EXAMPLE]
[Visual: Photo or org chart showing transformation]
"Company A: Moved from 12 functional departments to 6 cross-functional product teams. Result: Time-to-market dropped from 18 weeks to 8 weeks."

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"This is a real example (anonymised for confidentiality). They had traditional structure: separate engineering, design, product, data teams. They reorganised around products: one team per major customer problem. What happened? Not just speed. Quality improved. Engagement improved. Employees reported feeling more ownership."

---

[SLIDE 9: PATTERN 2 — Second element of solution]
[Visual: Diagram showing decision distribution]
"Pattern 2: Distributed Decision Authority
- Strategic decisions made centrally (vision, investment levels)
- Operating decisions made by teams (which features, which trade-offs)
- Clear decision frameworks ensure alignment without consensus"

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"The second pattern is about decision-making. Traditional organisations require consensus or senior approval for most decisions. This creates bottlenecks. High-performing organisations draw a clear line: what decisions happen at centre vs. what decisions happen at team level. This is not a free-for-all. Teams operate within guardrails. But guardrails set the boundary; they don't dictate every decision."

---

[SLIDE 10: PATTERN 2 CASE EXAMPLE]
[Visual: Decision framework or before/after timeline]
"Company B: Shifted 40% of product decisions from approval committee to team level. Result: Decision velocity increased 5x. Strategic alignment maintained."

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"Another real example. They had a product approval committee. Every feature needed sign-off. Average time from proposal to decision: 8 weeks. They created a decision framework: features under $500K impact? Team decides. Over $1M? Committee reviews. Strategic roadmap? Committee aligns; teams implement. Decision time dropped to 1-2 weeks. Alignment was actually better because people understood the boundaries."

---

[SLIDE 11: PATTERN 3 — Third element of solution]
[Visual: Role evolution diagram or skill matrix]
"Pattern 3: Generalists-with-Depth
- Hire and develop people with broad capabilities
- Cross-functional skill enables better collaboration
- Specialists still needed, but fewer and more distributed"

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"Third pattern: how you structure roles. Most enterprises have narrow specialists: data scientist does data, UX designer does design, product manager does product. Each role is deep but narrow. This creates handoffs and misalignment.

High-performing teams have people with broader skills. Product manager who understands data. Designer who understands engineering constraints. Engineer who understands product strategy. These broad skills don't replace depth; they enable better collaboration across boundaries."

---

[SLIDE 12: PATTERN 3 CASE EXAMPLE]
[Visual: Skills matrix or hiring approach]
"Company C: Developed product managers with data fluency. Result: Better product decisions, faster validation, reduced analytical handoffs."

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"In this case, they invested in teaching product managers basic data analysis. Not to replace data scientists. But to reduce dependency. Product managers could validate their own hypotheses. They could review analytics without waiting for analyst review. They asked better questions of data team because they understood the constraints. Outcome: faster iteration, smarter decisions."

---

[SLIDE 13: OBJECTIONS/COMPLICATIONS]
[Visual: Balanced representation of challenges]
"Common concerns:
- 'Won't specialization suffer?' Specialization is preserved; collaboration improves.
- 'This only works for tech companies.' Works across industries (we've seen examples in finance, retail, manufacturing).
- 'This is too much change at once.' Phased approach: start with one team, pilot, expand."

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"I know what you might be thinking. Won't we lose expertise? We studied this. Actually, expertise deepens when specialists have to teach others and collaborate across boundaries. Specialists in high-performing organisations are more expert, not less.

You might also be thinking: 'This only works for tech companies.' We've run pilots in finance (trading, risk management), retail (merchandising, supply chain), manufacturing (product development, supply). Principles apply broadly. The structure looks slightly different, but the logic is the same."

---

[SLIDE 14: IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK]
[Visual: Timeline, roadmap, or phased approach]
"Three-Phase Implementation:
Phase 1 (0-3 months): Pilot with one product team; learn what works
Phase 2 (3-6 months): Expand to 2-3 teams; refine approach
Phase 3 (6-12 months): Full rollout; address late-stage obstacles"

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"If you want to try this, here's how to approach it. Don't transform everything at once. Pick one team as pilot. This team has executive sponsorship, access to resources, and permission to do things differently. Run for three months. What worked? What needs adjustment? Then expand. Three teams get the new approach. Refine based on learnings. Then full rollout. This approach has higher success rates than big-bang transformations."

---

[SLIDE 15: CALL TO ACTION]
[Visual: Simple, clear CTA]
"Three questions for your organisation:
1. Are you organised around products or functions?
2. Where are decision bottlenecks?
3. What's the cost of slow execution?"

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"Before you leave, I want to leave you with three questions. First: How is your organisation structured? If it's functional, that's likely a constraint. Second: Where do decisions take forever? Name the bottleneck specifically. Third: What does slow execution cost you? Competitive advantage? Revenue? Market share? That number often justifies the cost of transformation.

If any of these questions resonate, I'd like to continue the conversation. I'm available for follow-ups; I have cards. Thank you."

---

[SLIDE 16: CONTACT / NEXT STEPS]
[Visual: Clean layout with contact info]
"Questions? Let's talk.
[Your name]
[Email]
[LinkedIn]

[Optional: offer]
- 30-minute consultation (free)
- Diagnostic assessment (1-day workshop)
- Speaking at your conference"

[SPEAKER NOTES]
"Thank you for the time. I'm happy to answer questions now, or contact me afterward. If you want to explore whether these patterns apply to your organisation, I offer a free 30-minute consultation. If you want to dig deeper, we run diagnostic workshops. And if your conference or company event is interested in having me speak, I'm available."
```

## Examples

### Good Presentation (Key Slides)

**Slide: The Situation**
- Headline: "70% of Digital Transformations Fail"
- Visual: Chart showing failure rate (with source noted small at bottom)
- Implied question: Why? That draws audience forward

**Slide: The Complication**
- Headline: "But Failure Isn't What You Think"
- Visual: Venn diagram showing Strategy, Technology, Organisation—with Organisation highlighted
- Message: Everyone focuses on strategy and technology; organisation is neglected

**Slide: The Resolution**
- Headline: "Three Moves Separate Success from Failure"
- Visual: Three boxes with move titles
- Message: Clear, specific, actionable

**Slide: Evidence**
- Visual: Chart showing outcomes (speed, adoption, retention) with numbers
- Annotation: source cited
- Message: This works; here's proof

---

### Bad Presentation (Key Issues)

**Slide: Dense text**
- 200 words on one slide
- Audience reads instead of listens
- Speaker reads bullet points
- Audience disengages

**Slide: Vague headline**
- "Digital Transformation"
- Doesn't communicate a specific insight
- Audience doesn't know why this slide matters

**Slide: Unsourced data**
- "Most companies think digital is important"
- No source; audience distrusts
- Distracts from main message

## Tactical Guidance

**Slide Design Principles:**

```
✓ One idea per slide
✓ Headline states the idea, not the category
✓ Max 40 words of text per slide
✓ Large, readable font (44pt minimum)
✓ High-quality visuals (don't use blurry photos or generic stock images)
✓ Data visualizations should be self-explanatory (not require speaker explanation)
✓ Consistent formatting (same font, colour scheme across deck)

✗ Dense text (slides are not documents)
✗ Bullet points with complete thoughts (break thoughts into phrases)
✗ Tiny font (audience can't read)
✗ Clip art or generic imagery (looks unprofessional)
✗ Animation effects (distracting)
✗ Multiple topics per slide (forces rushed pacing)
```

**Speaker Notes (What You Say vs. What's on Slide):**

The slide should have minimal text. Your speaker notes have detailed explanation:

```
Slide text: "70% of transformations fail. Why?"
Speaker notes: "I said earlier that most companies want to transform. Yet evidence shows that 70% of major transformation initiatives don't achieve their intended objectives. That's based on multiple studies—McKinsey data, Gartner research, our own observation of client engagements. I want to explore why this happens. It's not because companies lack resources. It's not because they lack executive commitment. Something else is at play, and that's what I want to uncover for you today."

Notice: Speaker notes provide context, evidence, transitions. Slide is clean and simple.
```

**Pacing and Energy:**

- **30-minute talk**: 15-20 slides (roughly 1.5-2 minutes per slide)
- **60-minute talk**: 30-40 slides (roughly 1.5-2 minutes per slide)
- **Variation**: Don't spend equal time on each slide; slow down on complex ideas, move quickly on setup
- **Interaction**: Every 5-7 slides, pause for Q&A or interactive element (poll, activity) to reset attention

**Data Visualization Standards:**

```
Good chart for presentation:
- Title explains finding (not just "Revenue Growth")
- Legend is clear
- Axes are labelled with units
- Source noted (small text at bottom)
- Caption explains implication (not just what it shows)
- Colour is high-contrast (readable from distance)

Bad chart:
- Tiny text (illegible from back of room)
- No title or legend
- Source missing
- Complicated (requires 2 minutes to understand)
- Passive colours (hard to see from distance)
```

**Consulting Pyramid Principle:**

Structure arguments like a pyramid:

```
Situation (broadest, most general)
        ↓
Complication (why it's hard, what's at stake)
        ↓
Resolution (specific solution)
        ↓
Evidence (proof this works)
        ↓
Implication (what you should do)
            ↑
        (narrowest, most specific)

This structure makes arguments both compelling (draws audience in) and memorable (specific insights stick).
```
