# LinkedIn

## Goal

Establish thought leadership within professional networks through evidence-based insights that drive conversation, build credibility, and create opportunities for collaboration or speaking.

## Success Metrics (2025-2026)

- **Engagement Rate**: 3-5% on posts (likes, comments, shares combined) after 7 days
- **Profile Visits**: 50+ profile visits per post within first week
- **Conversation Quality**: Comments from tier-1 network (recognised experts, decision-makers)
- **DM Inbound**: 2-3 meaningful collaboration inquiries per month from posts
- **Share Velocity**: 5+ reposts/shares per post within 48 hours

## Limits & Restrictions

### Technical
- **Character limit**: 3,000 characters (but keep hook under 150)
- **First line visibility**: Only first 60 characters visible in feed preview
- **Formatting**: Line breaks, emojis, bullet points increase scannability
- **Images**: 1200x628px optimal; carousel up to 10 images; video up to 10 minutes
- **Links**: Platform de-prioritises external links; use sparingly, always include context
- **Hashtags**: Max 5 per post, #PascalCase (algorithm tracks better than lowercase)

### Platform/Algorithm
- **Dwell time**: LinkedIn rewards comments and shares; likes are weighted less
- **Comment signals**: First 3 comments in first hour shape visibility; reply to all comments
- **Thread engagement**: Multi-part threads (carousels) outperform single posts by 2-3x
- **Posting time**: Tuesday-Thursday 8am-10am performs best (peak activity)
- **Document posts**: Native docs (white papers, research) get 2x engagement vs. links
- **Video**: Native video gets 5x reach vs. links to YouTube
- **DM shares**: If someone DMs your post, algorithm boosts to their network

### GGP Etiquette
- **No engagement bait**: Don't ask "like if you agree" or "comment your take"
- **Confidentiality**: Never name-drop clients; use "a Fortune 500 tech company" if needed
- **No industry complaints**: Avoid "why nobody understands X" posts; frame as opportunity
- **Attribution mandatory**: Name researchers, cite studies, link sources for claims
- **Respectful disagreement**: Acknowledge valid counterarguments; don't dunk on other viewpoints
- **No paid promotion masquerade**: If sponsored, clearly mark [SPONSORED] or [AD]

## Template

```
[HOOK — First line visible in preview, sets up curiosity]
One dataset we reviewed this week surprised me: 76% of organisations say they have a digital strategy, but only 12% can actually articulate what "digital" means to them.

[INSIGHT — What you learned or observed]
The gap isn't strategy. It's clarity. Teams conflate "we bought SaaS tools" with "we have a digital strategy."

[CONTEXT — Why this matters, who should care]
If you're leading transformation in a non-tech company, you know this problem: executives align on vision, but execution teams interpret it differently. Result: fractured roadmaps, wasted budget, friction.

[FRAMEWORK or EVIDENCE — How to think about it, what data shows]
Here's what the best performers do differently:
• Define specific metrics for "digital" (not just adoption %)
• Audit existing tools and data flows (most are siloed)
• Pilot in one function; prove ROI before scaling
• Measure culture shift, not just tech adoption

[CALL TO ACTION — Invite conversation, not "like this"]
What's been your biggest barrier to clarity in digital transformation? Curious what you've seen in your industry.

## Examples

### Good Example

**Post:**

"The best strategy meetings I've attended this year didn't have PowerPoint.

They had a shared Google Doc. Here's why it works:
- Everyone drafts simultaneously (removes status anxiety)
- Comments create a thinking trail (easier to backtrack later)
- No presenter fatigue (nobody has to 'perform')
- Recording is automatic (future reference, clarity)

If your next strategy meeting has 20 slides, you've lost someone by slide 5.

Have you run strategy on a doc instead? What changed?"

---

**Why this works:**
- Hook is specific and memorable ("didn't have PowerPoint")
- Structure is scannable (bullet points, short lines)
- Claims are based on observable evidence ("meetings I've attended")
- Insight is actionable (readers can do this today)
- CTA invites experience-sharing, not vanity metrics
- Tone is exploratory, not prescriptive

### Bad Example

**Post:**

"Everyone's doing digital transformation wrong! 😂 We figured it out and it's so simple. You won't believe what we found. Our CEO says we're the best in the industry. Like if you agree that most companies don't have a clue. Comment below and I'll send you a free guide that costs $500 elsewhere. #strategy #leadership #success"

---

**Why this fails:**
- Clickbait hook ("You won't believe") — no substance
- Self-promotional without credibility grounding ("we figured it out")
- Engagement bait ("like if you agree")
- No actual insight or evidence
- Desperate tone (giving away $500 guides)
- Too many generic hashtags
- Comes across as salesy, not thoughtful

## Tactical Guidance

**Posting Cadence:**
- 1-2 posts per week maximum (quality over frequency)
- Batch posts Tuesday-Thursday 8-10am for best reach
- Comment on posts in your feed first (builds algorithm favour before posting)

**Hook Formula:**
```
Start with ONE sentence that's:
✓ Specific (not "everyone should know X")
✓ Surprising (contradicts assumption or reveals gap)
✓ Relevant to audience (speaks to their role/challenge)

Examples:
- "76% of organisations say X, but only 12% can do Y" [data]
- "I spent 20 years thinking Z was required for success; it's not" [revelation]
- "The best teams I've worked with all do one thing differently" [intrigue]
```

**Mobile-First Formatting:**
- Use line breaks frequently (3-4 lines max before break)
- Keep sentences under 15 words when possible
- Emoji sparingly (one or two for visual interest, not decoration)
- Use numbered lists or bullets for clarity

**Hashtag Strategy:**
- 3-5 hashtags maximum, placed at end of post (not within text)
- Use #PascalCase: #DigitalTransformation not #digitaltransformation
- Mix industry-specific (#DigitalTransform) with broader (#Leadership)
- Research hashtag before using; ensure it's active (50K+ posts in last month)

**Engagement Protocol:**
- Reply to ALL comments within first 2 hours
- Keep replies brief (1-2 sentences); invite DM for detailed discussion
- Share other experts' relevant posts weekly (builds network goodwill)
- Don't argue; redirect disagreement to DMs ("Worth a longer chat — sending DM")

## Pre-Publication Checklist

- [ ] Hook (first line) is specific and under 60 characters; creates curiosity
- [ ] Post passes mobile readability test (short lines, clear breaks)
- [ ] All numerical claims have a source noted: "[VERIFIED]" or link to study
- [ ] No engagement bait ("like if you agree," "comment your take")
- [ ] No client names or confidential data; generic references only
- [ ] Tone is consultative, not prescriptive; acknowledges complexity
- [ ] Hashtags are in #PascalCase, max 5, placed at end
- [ ] CTA invites experience-sharing or conversation, not vanity metrics
- [ ] Claims are attributed or sourced (if citing someone, tag them or link source)
- [ ] No industry complaints or negativity; framed as opportunity if discussing problems
- [ ] GGP markers check: Are claims verifiable? Are estimates transparent? Is inference labelled as such?
- [ ] Ready to engage: Planned to reply to comments within 2 hours for first 24 hours
