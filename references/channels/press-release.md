# Press Release

## Goal

Official, legally-reviewed announcement of significant business developments (launches, funding, partnerships, leadership changes) for external distribution to media, investors, and public stakeholders.

## Success Metrics (2025-2026)

- **Pickup Rate**: 40%+ of targeted outlets mention announcement within 5 days
- **Reach**: 2M+ impressions across online coverage within first week
- **Positive Sentiment**: 90%+ of mentions are neutral or positive (no negative angles)
- **Quote Attribution**: 100% of quotes are attributed to named executives with titles
- **Accuracy**: Zero fact corrections or clarifications required post-publication
- **SEO Impact**: Announcement ranks in top 3 search results for key terms within 30 days

## Limits & Restrictions

### Technical
- **Format**: Plain text or PDF; follows AP style or Reuters format
- **Length**: 400-600 words (tight; every sentence earns space)
- **Headline**: 10-15 words; no jargon; includes key fact
- **Dateline**: City and date (e.g., "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 6, 2025")
- **Quotes**: Max 2-3 per release; 1-2 sentences each
- **Contact info**: Media contact with direct phone and email required
- **Boilerplate**: 2-3 sentences about company; goes after main body

### Platform/Algorithm
- **Wire distribution**: Distributed via PR Newswire, Business Wire, etc.; pricing $500-2K+ per release
- **Media targeting**: Journalists scan 50+ releases daily; subject line is make-or-break
- **Embargoes**: "For Immediate Release" or "EMBARGOED UNTIL [DATE/TIME]" in header
- **SEO timing**: Distribution at 9am ET Tuesday-Thursday for maximum pickup
- **Keyword density**: Include searchable terms 2-3x naturally (not spammy)
- **Link strategy**: Maximum 2-3 links to landing pages or resources

### GGP Etiquette
- **Legal review mandatory**: Every factual claim must be verified before distribution
- **Quote accuracy**: Executives must approve exact wording of attributed quotes
- **No false claims**: "Best-in-class," "industry-leading," etc. must be defensible
- **Competitive framing**: Describe own value, not competitor weakness
- **Attribution transparency**: Attribute claims to data sources or third-party research
- **No embellishment**: "Unprecedented" must be accurate; avoid superlatives without backup

---

**Why this works:**
- Headline has specific fact (acquisition) and business impact (expands services)
- Lead answers: what (acquisition), why (expands capabilities), when (Q2 2025)
- Quotes explain strategic value, not repeat headline
- All factual claims are specific: "95% retention," "85-person team," "40+ clients"
- CEO quote addresses competitive positioning (design + strategy advantage)
- Timeline and financial transparency (deal terms not disclosed, but integration timeline stated)
- Contact info is complete and current

### Bad Example

**HEADER:**
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**HEADLINE:**
Revolutionary Game-Changing Acquisition Announced!

**LEAD:**
Big news! Acme Consulting is super excited to announce a mega-acquisition of an amazing design company. This is literally the best partnership ever and will totally change the industry. Everyone thinks design is important and we're really good at it.

**QUOTE:**
"We're thrilled and honoured to be joining the Acme family," said the other guy. "This is such an incredible opportunity."

**BOILERPLATE:**
Acme Consulting is an industry leader and does consulting and stuff. We're really great.

---

**Why this fails:**
- Headline uses hype words without specific facts ("Revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Lead doesn't answer key questions: company name, deal value, timing, specific impact
- No data to back claims ("mega-acquisition," "best partnership ever")
- Quotes are vague and non-attributable ("the other guy")
- No name, title, or business rationale in second quote
- Boilerplate is unprofessional and lacks specifics
- No contact information
- No financial or timeline details
- Tone is unprofessional and will be rejected by media outlets

## Tactical Guidance

**Timing Strategy:**

- **Morning release**: 9am ET Tuesday-Thursday maximises pickup before end-of-day media cycles
- **Avoid Friday**: Friday releases miss Monday media coverage; save for less competitive news
- **Embargo timing**: If using embargo, set for 7am ET on announced release day (gives press 2 hours before trading opens)
- **Public trading**: Coordinate with investor relations; file 8-K or equivalent before release if material

**Quote Strategy:**

- **Executive quotes**: CEO or business unit lead; should address why this matters strategically
- **Partner/customer quotes**: Third-party validation; should address customer impact, not echo your marketing
- **Multiple quotes**: 2-3 max; don't make release quote-heavy
- **Quote approval**: Executive and any external quoted party must approve exact wording in advance

**Claim Verification:**

Every factual statement must have a source:

```
Claim: "85-person team"
Source: DesignCo headcount verification or contract agreement

Claim: "95% customer retention"
Source: DesignCo client audit or third-party review data

Claim: "40+ enterprise clients"
Source: Customer list or case study inventory

Claim: "Expected to close by Q2 2025"
Source: Deal legal documents or board approval minutes
```

**Distribution Strategy:**

- **Wire services**: PR Newswire or Business Wire for broad distribution ($500-2K)
- **Direct media**: Email to relevant journalists 15 min after wire distribution (embargo-honoured list)
- **Internal channels**: Internal announcement same day or day before (prevent leaks)
- **Social media**: Tweet/LinkedIn post day of release with link to full release

**Headline Formula:**

```
[Company Name] Announces [Specific Action: Acquires, Launches, Raises, Partners with]
[Specific Entity/Product], [Expected Impact: Expands, Enables, Brings]
[Business Outcome: New Market, Customer Segment, Capability]

Examples:
✓ Acme Consulting Acquires DesignCo, Expanding UX Services to Fortune 500
✓ Acme Raises $50M Series B to Expand European Operations
✓ Acme Launches AI-Powered Transformation Platform for Manufacturing
```
