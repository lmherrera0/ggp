# SWOT Analysis

## Purpose
SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) provides a structured assessment of internal capabilities and external market context for strategic planning. It answers "What are our competitive advantages? What are our vulnerabilities? What can we capitalize on? What risks should we prepare for?" Use this when a brief asks to "develop strategy," "assess competitive position," "identify risk factors," or "plan market entry."

## When to Use
- Strategic planning (identifying strategic priorities)
- Competitive positioning assessment
- Risk identification and mitigation planning
- Market entry or expansion evaluation
- Product/service launch planning
- Organisational restructuring or capability building
- Annual strategy review and refresh
- M&A due diligence (assessment of target)

## GGP Verification Requirements

**This is where SWOT analysis hallucinates most:**

### Primary Fabrication Risks

1. **Generic Strengths Without Evidence** — AI lists obvious statements
   - RULE: Every strength must be [CONFIRMED] evidenced with data or [INFERENCE] contextualized against competitors
   - RULE: "Strong team" is worthless; "team includes 3 of the 5 people who built competitor X" is evidence
   - RULE: Mark competitive strengths with source (vs. what competitor? per what measure?)

2. **Invented Market Opportunities** — AI assumes market trends without source
   - RULE: Every opportunity claim needs [CONFIRMED] market data (analyst report, regulatory change, etc.)
   - RULE: Never state "growing market" without source; cite growth rate and source
   - RULE: Flag assumptions about market receptivity (would customers adopt this?)

3. **Unverified Competitive Threats** — AI assumes competitor threat without evidence
   - RULE: Threat claims require [CONFIRMED] competitor data or [INFERENCE] explicit assumption
   - RULE: Never assume "Competitor X will enter our market"; flag as [INFERENCE] with scenario
   - RULE: External threats need source (regulatory guidance, analyst perspective, market data)

4. **Confusing Strengths with Strategy** — AI lists strategic aspirations as current strengths
   - RULE: Strengths are what you have TODAY (evidenced); not what you plan to build
   - RULE: If something requires investment, it's an opportunity or initiative, not a strength

5. **Unbalanced SWOT** — AI focuses on strengths and opportunities, ignores weaknesses/threats
   - RULE: Balanced SWOT shows vulnerabilities and risks, not just upside
   - RULE: If all items are positive, you haven't dug deep enough

6. **Missing Strategic Implications** — AI lists items without connecting to strategy
   - RULE: SWOT is only useful if it drives decisions
   - RULE: Each item should connect to a strategic question or decision

## Methodology

### Step 1: Define Scope & Context
1. **What are we analyzing?** Entire organisation? Specific product? Market entry?
2. **Competitive set:** Who are our key competitors? Who are we comparing against?
3. **Time horizon:** 1-year strategy? 3-year plan?
4. **Current context:** Market conditions, recent events that should shape analysis

### Step 2: Identify Internal Strengths (Real Data)
1. **Brainstorm:** Internal capabilities, assets, financial position, talent, products
2. **Verify:** Each strength gets a marker ([CONFIRMED]/[INFERENCE]/[UNVERIFIED])
3. **Benchmark:** How does each strength compare to competitors? Is it truly an advantage?
4. **Discard weak items:** "We have a website" is not a strength if every competitor does too

**Critical:** Every strength must be evidenced or explicitly competitive (vs. what competitor).

### Step 3: Identify Internal Weaknesses (Be Honest)
1. **Audit:** What are we bad at? Gaps in capability, talent, resources, process?
2. **Customer feedback:** What do customers complain about? What features are missing?
3. **Competitive comparison:** Where do we lose deals? On what dimensions?
4. **Financial analysis:** What metrics lag? Cost structure? Margins?

**Critical:** Weaknesses are hard to admit; push for honesty. This is where strategy gets made.

### Step 4: Identify External Opportunities (Source Data)
1. **Market trends:** Is the market growing? New segments emerging?
2. **Regulatory changes:** New laws creating demand? Compliance requirements creating market?
3. **Competitive moves:** Competitor A leaving market, creating opening?
4. **Technology shifts:** New tech enabling new business models?
5. **Customer signals:** Are customers asking for new capabilities? Entering new verticals?

**Critical:** Every opportunity claim needs a source. Don't invent market trends.

### Step 5: Identify External Threats (Verify Before Listing)
1. **Competitive threats:** New competitor? Well-funded competitor? Competitor entering our market?
2. **Market threats:** Market declining? Customer consolidation? Shift to different model?
3. **Regulatory threats:** Compliance requirements increasing? Data privacy rules?
4. **Technology threats:** Disruptive tech that could commoditize our business?
5. **Economic threats:** Economic downturn? Inflation affecting costs?

**Critical:** Threats feel real but may be speculative. Source everything. Distinguish confirmed threats from risks.

### Step 6: Link SWOT to Strategy (Not Just a List)
1. **For each strength:** How do we leverage this competitively?
2. **For each weakness:** What's our plan to address it? Build, hire, acquire, outsource?
3. **For each opportunity:** Do we have the strengths to pursue it? What gaps must we close?
4. **For each threat:** What's our mitigation? Which strengths help us defend?

### Step 7: Prioritise (What's Most Important?)
1. **High-impact strengths:** Which are most defensible? Most valuable to customers?
2. **Critical weaknesses:** Which gaps would most impede strategy?
3. **Highest-potential opportunities:** Which could expand addressable market the most?
4. **Biggest threats:** Which would most damage competitive position?

## Common Hallucination Traps

### Trap 1: Generic Strengths Without Evidence
**[FABRICATION]:** "Strengths: Strong team, good culture, high-quality products"
✓ **GROUNDED:** "[CONFIRMED] Team strength: 40% have prior [industry] experience vs. competitor avg 20% (verified via LinkedIn). Competitive advantage: Faster time to productivity on domain problems. [INFERENCE] Culture strength: 8% turnover vs. 15% industry avg (HR data); assumption: Low turnover indicates culture quality."

### Trap 2: Invented Market Opportunities
**[FABRICATION]:** "Opportunity: Growing market demand for [solution]"
✓ **GROUNDED:** "[CONFIRMED] [Market segment] growing at 25% CAGR per Gartner 2025 forecast. Market size projected to grow from $2B to $4B by 2028. [INFERENCE] We estimate 5% market share achievable given competitive positioning, assuming we close [specific gaps]."

### Trap 3: Unverified Competitive Threats
**[FABRICATION]:** "Threat: Competitor X will disrupt our market with new technology"
✓ **GROUNDED:** "[INFERENCE] Competitor X raised $50M (confirmed via Crunchbase). Analyst commentary suggests they may pursue [strategy]. Our risk: If they achieve [capability], could impact our market share. Probability: [INFERENCE] Medium (plausible but not confirmed). Mitigation: [Specific action]."

### Trap 4: Confusing Strategy with Current Strengths
**[FABRICATION]:** "Strengths: Enterprise sales capability, AI-powered analytics, global operations"
✓ **GROUNDED:** "Current strengths: [CONFIRMED] Mid-market customer base (proven sales model). Strategic opportunity: Build enterprise sales (currently weak, this is aspirational, not current strength). DO NOT list as strength today."

### Trap 5: Unbalanced SWOT (All Positive)
**[FABRICATION]:** 15 strengths, 2 opportunities, 0 weaknesses, 0 threats
✓ **GROUNDED:** Balanced SWOT with honest assessment of vulnerabilities. Every organisation has weaknesses and faces threats. If yours doesn't show, you haven't dug deep enough.

### Trap 6: Threats Without Probability Assessment
**[FABRICATION]:** "Threat: Tech giant may enter our market"
✓ **GROUNDED:** "[INFERENCE] Tech giant may enter market. Probability: Low (they have not signaled interest; analyst assessment suggests <20% chance within 2 years). Mitigation if occurs: [Specific plan]. Monitoring: [How we'll detect shift]."

### Trap 7: No Strategic Implication
**[FABRICATION]:** SWOT is a list with no connection to strategy or decisions
✓ **GROUNDED:** Each SWOT item connects to a strategic decision: "Given our strength in [X] and market opportunity in [Y], we will invest in [Z] team. Given weakness in [W], we will hire [role] by [date]. Given threat [T], we will deepen [mitigation]."

## Examples

### Good Example: SWOT Analysis (Properly Grounded)

```
# SWOT ANALYSIS: Market Entry — Enterprise Segment

## STRENGTHS

**Strong Brand in Mid-Market**
- [CONFIRMED]: Top-3 brand recognition in mid-market (brand tracking study, N=500, 2025)
- Competitive advantage: Early consideration in RFPs; trust with buyers

- Competitive advantage: Differentiation vs. 5 direct competitors
- Application to enterprise: Addresses enterprise-scale requirement that competitors don't meet

**Strong Customer Relationships**
- [CONFIRMED]: Net retention rate 115% (upsell/expansion); customer satisfaction 8.2/10
- Competitive advantage: Customers expanding with us; low churn
- Application to enterprise: We can use existing customers as reference accounts; easier to expand upmarket from existing base

**Weak Spot — Limited R&D Budget**
- [CONFIRMED]: R&D is 3% of revenue vs. industry avg 7% for enterprise vendors
- Competitive vulnerability: Slower to add features competitors can match
- Impact on enterprise entry: Will compete on reliability/service, not feature velocity

---

## WEAKNESSES

**No Enterprise Sales Experience**
- [CONFIRMED]: 0 enterprise deals closed; sales team focused on mid-market (4-person team, avg deal $500K)
- Competitive vulnerability: Enterprise sales is different (longer cycle, complex procurement, executive-level negotiations)
- Impact on enterprise entry: Must hire/train enterprise sales team (6-month ramp); estimated 2 enterprise sales hires needed

**Weak Brand in Enterprise Market**
- [CONFIRMED]: Brand awareness in enterprise segment only 12% (vs. 65% in mid-market); tracker doesn't recognise us
- Competitive vulnerability: Not in early consideration; have to win on merits, not recognition

- Impact on enterprise entry: Must hire professional services team OR require customers to use partners; estimated 3-5 implementation consultants

**Architecture Not Enterprise-Ready**
- [INFERENCE]: Current architecture handles mid-market scale (1M transactions/day); enterprise customers will demand 10M+ transactions/day
- Technical risk: May need significant replatforming; estimated $500K-$1M and 6-month timeline
- Impact on enterprise entry: Blocker; can't sell if we can't scale to enterprise volume

---

## OPPORTUNITIES

**Enterprise Segment Growing, Competitors Weak**
- [CONFIRMED]: Gartner forecasts 30% CAGR in [market segment] 2025-2028 for enterprise solutions
- [CONFIRMED]: Market leader [Competitor A] focused on SMB; has poor enterprise satisfaction (NPS 35)
- Market opening: Opportunity to position as "enterprise-focused" player
- Size: If we capture 3% of enterprise market by 2028, = $150M revenue opportunity

**Partnership Channel Emerging**
- [CONFIRMED]: [Large consulting firm] actively recruiting solutions partners; 500+ customer relationships

---

## THREATS

**Well-Funded Competitors Pivoting to Enterprise**
- [CONFIRMED]: Competitor X (Series C, $50M funding) announced enterprise segment focus
- Competitive threat: They have budget to hire enterprise sales, invest in marketing, build out services
- Our vulnerability: Our weak enterprise brand means we'll compete head-to-head
- Timeline: They'll likely launch enterprise offering within 6-12 months

**Incumbent Vendor Defending Market Share**
- [UNVERIFIED] - Assumption: Incumbent [Competitor B] will drop prices to defend enterprise market
- Competitive threat: Price competition would compress our margins
- Our defensibility: Our proprietary tech justifies premium pricing IF we can convince enterprise buyers
- Risk: If price becomes primary decision factor, our differentiation doesn't matter

**Integration Complexity Could Be Blocker**
- [INFERENCE]: Enterprise customers will demand integration with [systems]. Our platform doesn't natively integrate.
- Technical threat: Could lose deals on integrations; would require custom work
- Mitigation: Open API + partner ecosystem; estimated $300K to build API marketplace

---

## Strategic Implications

### Decision 1: Replatform or Partner?
- **Weakness:** Architecture not enterprise-ready
- **Threat:** Competitors will have enterprise-ready solutions within 12 months
- **Decision:** Replatform (build in-house) vs. Partner with [platform vendor]
- **Timing:** Decide by Q2 2026; execute by Q4 2026

### Decision 2: Build Sales or Use Channel?
- **Weakness:** No enterprise sales team
- **Opportunity:** Partnership channel available
- **Decision:** Hybrid model — hire 2 enterprise account executives + invest in partner channel (consulting firm)
- **Timing:** Recruit by Q2 2026; partner agreement by Q1 2026

### Decision 3: Market Entry Sequencing
- **Opportunity:** Enterprise segment growing; competitors weak
- **Weakness:** Multiple gaps (brand, sales, tech, services)
- **Decision:** Pilot enterprise entry with 3-5 strategic customers (reference accounts); learn before scaling
- **Timeline:** Q2-Q4 2026

# SWOT ANALYSIS FAIL PROBLEMS BELOW

## STRENGTHS
"Strong brand" ← NO EVIDENCE
"Innovative team" ← TOO VAGUE
"Market-leading products" ← SELF-SERVING
"Efficient operations" ← COMPARED TO WHOM?

Should be: Specific strengths with competitive context (vs. which competitor? per what measure?)

## WEAKNESSES
"Some staff turnover" ← UNDERSTATEMENT; AVOIDS HONEST ASSESSMENT
[Only 1-2 weaknesses listed] ← UNBALANCED

Should be: Honest, specific weaknesses with numbers. Every org has real gaps.

## OPPORTUNITIES
"Growing market" ← NO SOURCE
"Customer demand for X" ← BASED ON WHAT DATA?
"Regulatory change could help" ← SPECULATIVE WITHOUT SOURCE

Should be: Each opportunity sourced (Gartner, analyst, regulatory guidance)

## THREATS
[Barely any threats listed] ← UNREALISTIC
"Competitors might enter market" ← TOO VAGUE AND ASSUMED

Should be: Specific threats with probability and source

## Strategic Implication
[No discussion of how SWOT connects to strategy]
[No decisions or actions specified]

Should be: Each SWOT item should connect to a strategic decision or action plan
