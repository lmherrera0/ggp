## Data Verification Standards

Rules for verifying data claims in professional communications:

- **Statistical claims** require methodology disclosure (sample size, confidence level, test type)
- **Percentages** must specify base/denominator ("15% of 500 respondents" not just "15%")
- **Year-over-year comparisons** must use consistent periods (same months/quarters)
- **Currency figures** must specify currency and whether nominal/real values
- **Market size claims** must specify methodology (TAM/SAM/SOM breakdown)
- **Growth rates** must distinguish CAGR (compound annual) vs. point-to-point
- **Survey data** must disclose sample size, methodology, margin of error, and date
- **Benchmarks** require source identification and comparable scope
- **Trend claims** need minimum 3 data points spanning sufficient timeframe

## Metric Presentation Rules

How to present KPIs and metrics without hallucinating:

- **Always specify time period and scope**: "Q3 2025 North America" not "Q3 growth"
- **Never extrapolate without declaring INFERENCE**: "If trend continues..." is an inference
- **Round appropriately**: Don't present false precision ("12.347%" from 100-sample survey)
- **Distinguish leading vs. lagging indicators**: Revenue (lagging) vs. pipeline velocity (leading)
- **Specify whether absolute or relative measures**: "Increased 5 units" vs. "Increased 5%"
- **Define all acronyms on first use** in the same section
- **Consistency rule**: Same metric always uses same calculation method and timeframe
- **Confidence intervals**: For estimates and projections, state uncertainty range

## Data Source Hierarchy

Adapting GGP source tiers specifically for data/analytics:

### Tier 1 — Data Gold Standard [🟢 **CONFIRMED**]
- Audited financial statements (GAAP/IFRS certified)
- Official government statistics (ONS, BLS, Eurostat, ABS)
- Regulated filings (SEC 10-K, FCA disclosures, company annual reports)
- Internal verified databases with audit trails
- Peer-reviewed academic research with replication

### Tier 2 — Reliable Data [🟢 **CONFIRMED**]
- Major analyst firms (Gartner Magic Quadrant, IDC research, Forrester)
- Financial data terminals (Bloomberg, Reuters, FactSet)
- Industry body published statistics (e.g., SIFMA, ICMA)
- University research centres with methodology transparency
- Government surveys with published sampling methodology

### Tier 3 — Useful Context [🟡 **INFERENCE**]
- Company press releases with unaudited figures (verify against filings)
- Industry surveys (always check sample size and methodology)
- Market research previews and abstracts (note: full data often paywalled)
- Wikipedia for definitions and historical context only
- Conference presentations with disclosed data sources

### Tier 4 — Proceed with Caution [🟠 **UNVERIFIED**]
- Social media metrics and viral claims
- Unverified benchmarks ("typical ROI")
- "Industry average" without cited source
- Blog-cited statistics (trace to original source)
- Conference slide claims without methodological backing
- Sponsored content and white papers (bias risk)

## Dashboard & Report Narratives

GGP rules specifically for writing narratives around data:

- **Traceability rule**: Every number must have a documented source with tier rating
- **Trend language**: "Revenue increased 12% YoY" only if you have prior-year comparable
- **Avoid weak language**: Don't say "shows a clear trend" without statistical significance testing
- **Comparison language**: Use neutral terms ("higher than," "lower than") not evaluative ("better," "worse")
- **Anomaly declarations**: Call out outliers when they distort the narrative; explain if they're data errors or genuine signals
- **Causation claims**: Require causal evidence; use "associated with" or "correlates with" instead
- **Context always**: Standalone numbers have no meaning; include benchmarks, targets, or prior periods
- **Caveats must be visible**: Don't hide limitations in footnotes; surface them in main narrative

## Common Data Hallucination Patterns

Specific anti-hallucination rules for data contexts:

### Pattern: Invented Precision
- **Detection**: Source says "approximately 24%" but you write "23.7%"
- **Rule**: Match precision to source precision
- **Mark as**: [🟠 **UNVERIFIED**] [⚠️ **RISK**] — Flag and revise to source value

### Pattern: Conflated Metrics
- **Detection**: Mixing revenue with profit, Monthly Active Users (MAU) with Daily Active Users (DAU)
- **Rule**: Define metric once, use consistently, note when switching metrics
- **Mark as**: [🟠 **UNVERIFIED**] [⚠️ **RISK**] — Rewrite with clarity on which metric each claim uses

### Pattern: Cherry-Picked Timeframes
- **Detection**: Highlighting H1 performance without showing H2, selecting most favorable quarter
- **Rule**: Present full-year or multi-year context; explain if focusing on specific period
- **Mark as**: [🟡 **INFERENCE**] — Declare the selection and provide context

### Pattern: Survivorship Bias
- **Detection**: Only referencing successful companies' practices, ignoring failures
- **Rule**: Acknowledge the subset; note "among companies that survived" if applicable
- **Mark as**: [🟡 **INFERENCE**] — Add caveat about sample composition

### Pattern: Correlation as Causation
- **Detection**: "X led to Y" without experimental or causal evidence
- **Rule**: Use "associated with," "correlates with," or "preceded"; avoid "caused," "drove," "led to"
- **Mark as**: [🟡 **INFERENCE**] — Rephrase with appropriate causal language

### Pattern: Missing Denominators
- **Detection**: "500 customers" without context ("out of 50,000" vs. "out of 600")
- **Rule**: Always include base population and percentage
- **Mark as**: [🔴 **GAP**] — Cannot assess significance without denominator; mark for research

### Pattern: Zombie Statistics
- **Detection**: Using 2015 data in 2025 report presented as current
- **Rule**: Date all data; flag anything older than 2 years unless explicitly historical
- **Mark as**: [🟠 **UNVERIFIED**] — Update or explicitly label as historical data

## Data Visualization Ethics

Rules for when content references or describes charts/graphs:

- **Never describe patterns the data doesn't support**: If chart shows flat line, don't say "strong growth"
- **Axis manipulation disclosure**: If y-axis doesn't start at zero, must state this
- **Sample size visibility**: Charts must show or text must declare the N
- **Confidence intervals**: For estimates and projections, show or mention uncertainty bands
- **Colour coding**: If using colour to imply good/bad (green/red), ensure neutral data supports it
- **GGP markers in chart narratives**: Apply [🟢 **CONFIRMED**]/[🟡 **INFERENCE**]/[🟠 **UNVERIFIED**] to all pattern claims just as in text
- **Annotation integrity**: Callout boxes must cite supporting data points

HEADLINE: [Key finding in one sentence]

METRIC: [Primary KPI] = [Value] [🟢 CONFIRMED]/[🟡 INFERENCE]/[🟠 UNVERIFIED]
PERIOD: [Exact timeframe: "Q3 2025" or "July 1 – September 30, 2025"]
TREND: [Direction + magnitude, e.g., "Up 12% YoY"] [🟢 CONFIRMED]/[🟡 INFERENCE]
CONTEXT: [Benchmark or comparison: vs. target, prior period, market]
IMPLICATION: [What this means for decisions]

## Pre-Publication Data Checklist

Final validation specifically for data-heavy content:

- [ ] **Traceability**: All numbers have a documented source with tier rating
- [ ] **Precision match**: Decimal places match source precision (no invented decimals)
- [ ] **Time periods explicit**: Every metric specifies its timeframe ("Q3 2025", "12-month average")
- [ ] **Units and currency**: All figures specify currency (USD, EUR), units (%, absolute, per capita)
- [ ] **Methodology disclosed**: Any percentage, average, or statistical claim states how it was calculated
- [ ] **Baseline consistency**: Comparisons (YoY, vs. target) use identical calculation methods
- [ ] **Caveats visible**: Limitations, sample sizes, and assumptions stated in main narrative
