## Source Tier Classification

Establish source credibility using a four-tier hierarchy. This determines confidence levels and required validation rigor.

| Tier | Category | Examples | Trust Level | Validation |
|------|----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **1** | Primary/Authoritative | SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q), government databases, peer-reviewed journals, regulatory bodies, official entity press releases, court documents, audited financial statements | High confidence | Use as primary evidence; cite directly |
| **2** | Reputable Secondary | Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, Reuters, BBC, established analysts (Gartner, McKinsey, Forrester), recognised trade publications, official industry reports | Good confidence | Verify if critical to conclusion; cross-reference for major claims |
| **3** | General Secondary | General news outlets, industry blogs from known experts, company marketing websites, Wikipedia (context only), established academic institutions | Moderate confidence | Cross-reference recommended; disclose secondary nature |
| **4** | Unverified/Low Quality | Forums, social media, anonymous blogs, content farms, sites with clear commercial bias, outdated content (>2 years for fast-moving sectors), unattributed claims | Low confidence | NEVER mark as CONFIRMED; requires corroboration from Tier 1-2 |

### Epistemological Criteria

Source tiers are determined by three epistemological criteria:

| Criterion | Definition |
|-----------|-----------|
| **(a) Institutional backing** | Published or endorsed by a recognised institution (government, university, professional body, established publisher) |
| **(b) Peer corroboration** | Claims independently verified or corroborated by multiple credible sources |
| **(c) Methodological transparency** | Methods, data sources, and limitations are explicitly disclosed and reproducible |

**Tier-to-criteria mapping:**

| Tier | (a) Institutional backing | (b) Peer corroboration | (c) Methodological transparency |
|------|:------------------------:|:---------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| **1** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **2** | Yes | Partial | Partial |
| **3** | At most 1 criterion met | — | — |
| **4** | None | None | None |

---

## Source Citation Format

Every CONFIRMED claim must include complete metadata. Use this template:

```
[🟢 CONFIRMED: Source Name | Tier X | Location | Date | URL]
```

### Citation Components (All Required)

- **Source Name**: Exact publication/organisation name
- **Tier**: Classification (1, 2, 3, or 4)
- **Location**: Specific section, page number, or paragraph reference
- **Date**: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **URL**: Direct link to source (include archive URL if source may be deleted)

### Inline Example

```
[🟢 CONFIRMED: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission | Tier 1 | Apple Inc. Form 10-K, Item 1A Risk Factors | 2024-11-08 | https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/...]
```

### APA Reference Example (for human audit traceability)

Every CONFIRMED claim must also produce a full APA-style entry in the Reference Audit section at the end of the deliverable. This enables human reviewers to verify sources independently.

```
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (2024). Apple Inc. Form 10-K Annual Report.
    SEC EDGAR, Item 1A Risk Factors, pp. 12–15.
    https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/...
    Tier: 1 | Accessed: 2024-11-08
```

**APA format rules:**
- Author/Organisation. (Year). *Title*. Publisher/Journal, Volume(Issue), pp. XX–XX. URL
- Include page/section numbers for precise traceability
- Include access date for online sources
- Append GGP Tier classification after the standard APA entry

## Source Quality Indicators

Evaluate each source using structured assessment:

```
📚 SOURCE EVALUATION
Source: [Full publication name]
├─ Tier: [1, 2, 3, or 4]
├─ Publication Date: YYYY-MM-DD
├─ Author: [Named individual, organisation, or "Anonymous"]
├─ Location: [Section, heading, paragraph number]
├─ URL: [Direct link]
├─ Quality Signals: [Peer review status, editorial board, fact-checking, corrections policy]
└─ Recommendation: [Action — use as primary, corroborate, downgrade, reject]
```

### Key Quality Signals

- **Author attribution**: Named experts boost credibility
- **Editorial standards**: Fact-checking, corrections policy, editorial board
- **Peer review**: Present in academic sources
- **Currency**: Recent publication more credible for fast-moving topics
- **Primary vs. secondary**: Direct observation/data better than hearsay
- **Independence**: Sources without financial conflict superior

---

## Source Red Flags

Certain patterns require immediate action. Apply the rule shown for each flag.

| Red Flag | Trigger | Required Action |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| No author attribution | Author field blank or "Staff" | Downgrade minimum one tier; seek attributed version |
| Publication date >2 years | Older than current date for fast-moving sector | Flag as potentially outdated; seek recent corroboration |
| Commercial interest evident | Obvious bias toward product/service | Disclose bias explicitly; seek independent corroboration |
| Circular sourcing detected | Source B cites Source A which cites Source B | Trace to original primary source; use primary only |
| Unfamiliar domain | Website or publisher unknown | Downgrade to Tier 4; verify against known sources |
| Contradicts Tier 1 source | Claims conflict with primary authority | Flag contradiction; defer to Tier 1 as ground truth |
| Vague attribution pattern | "Studies show", "experts say", "research indicates" | Reject the claim; mark as UNVERIFIED; seek specific source |
| Statistics without methodology | Numbers presented without sample size/method | Flag limitations; request methodology documentation |

---

## Handling Conflicting Sources

When sources contradict, follow this resolution hierarchy:

1. **Tier Resolution**: Higher tier source wins (Tier 1 > Tier 2 > Tier 3 > Tier 4)
2. **Recency Tie-Breaker**: When tiers equal, more recent source preferred
3. **Primary vs. Secondary**: Direct evidence beats interpretation
4. **Explicit Conflict Flag**: If Tier 1 sources differ, present both; note uncertainty
5. **Root Cause Investigation**: Determine why sources differ (methodology, time period, scope)

### Template for Conflict Presentation

```
[RISK] SOURCE CONFLICT
Claim: [Statement in question]

Position A: [Source 1, Tier X, Date]
- Finding: [Specific claim]
- Strength: [Why credible]

Position B: [Source 2, Tier X, Date]
- Finding: [Specific claim]
- Strength: [Why credible]

Resolution: [Which prevails and why, or note genuine uncertainty]
```

## Marker Integration Rules

Connect source tiers to confidence markers. This table governs which markers can be used with which sources:

| Marker | Allowed Sources | Required | Example |
|--------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| [🟢 **CONFIRMED**] | Tier 1-3 with full citation; no red flags present | Complete metadata citation | SEC filing stating revenue figure |
| [🟠 **UNVERIFIED**] | Tier 4 sources OR Tier 1-3 with red flags present | Explain why unverified | Claim attributed to "experts" without specific source |
| [🟡 **INFERENCE**] | Zero direct source; reasoned from confirmed facts | Show logical chain | "If X confirmed and Y confirmed, then Z is likely" |
| [🔴 **GAP**] | No source found or insufficient information | Mark as missing | "No available data on this specific metric" |
| [⚠️ **RISK**] | Reputational, legal, or credibility concern | Describe risk | "This claim could create liability if challenged" |

**Critical Rule**: Tier 4 sources CANNOT produce [🟢 **CONFIRMED**] markers under any circumstances. Mark as [🟠 **UNVERIFIED**] instead.

---

## Prohibited Language Patterns

Certain words and phrases must trigger INFERENCE or UNVERIFIED labeling. Use this table to identify and replace them:

| Category | Prohibited | Must Use Instead | Marker |
|----------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Frequency** | typically, usually, generally, often, sometimes | "According to [Source], X% report..." or cite specific data | UNVERIFIED |
| **Suggestion** | implies, suggests, indicates, hints | "Research shows", "stated directly as" | INFERENCE or UNVERIFIED |
| **Vague Attribution** | experts say, studies show, it is known, people believe | Cite specific expert/study/source | UNVERIFIED |
| **Approximation** | approximately, around, about, roughly | For precise data: cite exact figure or note estimate with margin | Note as estimate |
| **False Certainty** | clearly, obviously, certainly, definitely, undoubtedly | "Available evidence suggests", "Based on [Source]..." | INFERENCE |
| **Probability** | likely, unlikely, probably, seems, appears, may | Use explicit probability or cite source | INFERENCE |
| **Obligation** | must be, should be, would be, needs to be | "Required by [Rule]" or "Best practice per [Source]" | RULE or CONFIRMED |

### Example Correction

**FAIL Bad**: "Studies typically show that companies generally benefit from digitalization."
**[GOOD]**: "[🟢 **CONFIRMED**: McKinsey & Company, 'Digital Acceleration in Enterprises,' 2023] reports that 73% of surveyed companies cite improved operational efficiency."

## Fallback Rules

Apply these rules when standard verification is insufficient or ambiguous:

| Situation | Required Action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Source is paywalled or inaccessible | Cite the source fully; note access limitation; seek alternative corroboration |
| Conflicting Tier 1 sources with equal authority | Present both views; explicitly note the disagreement; avoid false consensus |
| Information is current/breaking (< 7 days old) | Flag as preliminary; indicate likely updates; plan to revisit |
| Quantitative data lacks full context | Always cite sample size, methodology, time period, and limitations |
| Claim spans multiple jurisdictions with different rules | Specify which jurisdiction(s) apply; note variations |
| Source has issued corrections or retracted claims | Use corrected version; cite the correction; note original error only if relevant |
