## Quick Check Matrix

Evaluate any significant statement or action across all eight dimensions (scored 1-3, max 24). Rate each as Low (1), Medium (2), or High (3). Maximum score: 24.

| Dimension | Low (1) | Medium (2) | High (3) |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Misinterpretation Risk** | Clear, hard to misread | Could be read multiple ways | Easily distorted or weaponized |
| **Credibility Risk** | Strong sourcing; defensible | Some sourcing gaps; arguable | Unsourced or contradicted claims |
| **Legal Risk** | No legal exposure | Gray area; consult guidelines | Clear legal liability or exposure |
| **Reputation Risk** | Aligns with brand values | Neutral or slightly off-brand | Contradicts brand; damages credibility |
| **Data Accuracy Risk** | All data sourced and verified | Some figures unverified or estimated | Key statistics unsourced or challengeable |
| **Hostile Reader Test** | No exploitable weaknesses | Some points vulnerable to challenge | Easily weaponized or distorted out of context |
| **Screenshot Test** | Comfortable if shared without context | Would need minor explanation | Would cause reputational damage if shared |
| **CEO Test** | CEO would approve without question | Would need brief justification | CEO would reject or demand changes |

**Action Rule** (max 24):
- Score ≤8: Generally safe to proceed
- Score ≥9: Flag for escalation; recommend human review before proceeding

## The Three Tests

Apply these three filters to any significant communication, recommendation, or public statement.

### Test 1: Hostile Reader Test

Read your statement as if you were an adversary looking for weaknesses. Use this checklist:

- [ ] **Could this be read as attacking someone?** Who might feel criticized?
- [ ] **Are there unstated assumptions?** What if someone disagrees with them?
- [ ] **Is my evidence airtight?** Could someone credibly challenge my sources?
- [ ] **Am I using vague language that invites interpretation?** What's the worst reasonable reading?
- [ ] **Does this create legal exposure?** Could this be seen as defamatory, misleading, or negligent?
- [ ] **Is this proportionate?** Does the strength of my claim match the strength of my evidence?
- [ ] **Could this be quoted out of context?** Would the shortened version still be true and fair?
- [ ] **Is any claim circular?** Does the evidence depend on accepting the conclusion it's supposed to prove?
- [ ] **Are foreseeable objections pre-addressed?** Would a knowledgeable critic find their obvious challenge already answered, or left open?

**Scoring**: Low (1) = no exploitable weaknesses; Medium (2) = some points vulnerable to challenge; High (3) = easily weaponized or distorted out of context. Record score in Quick Check Matrix.

#### Cognitive Bias Check

If any of the above checks raise concerns, also scan for these common biases that damage credibility when spotted by informed readers:

- [ ] **Confirmation Bias**: Does the text only cite evidence that supports the conclusion, while ignoring or downplaying counter-evidence? `[COGNITIVE_BIAS: Confirmation]`
- [ ] **Survivorship Bias**: Are only successes or positive cases presented? Are failures, dropouts, or negative outcomes systematically absent? `[COGNITIVE_BIAS: Survivorship]`
- [ ] **Status Quo Bias**: Is maintaining the current state framed as the safe option, when inaction may carry equal or greater risk? `[COGNITIVE_BIAS: StatusQuo]`
- [ ] **Recency Bias**: Are recent events or trends being extrapolated as permanent or definitive, without historical context? `[COGNITIVE_BIAS: Recency]`

**If detected**: Name the bias in your risk flag. A named bias is actionable; a vague "evidence might be incomplete" is not.

---

### Test 2: Screenshot Test

Imagine this statement or decision was captured in a screenshot and shared without context on social media, in a legal proceeding, or to your firm's leadership.

**Questions**:
1. Would I still be comfortable with it?
2. Could it be misused to damage my reputation or my firm's?
3. If shared with the CEO, would this require explanation or justification?
4. If a journalist quoted this out of context, would it still be defensible?

**Scoring**: Low (1) = comfortable if shared without context; Medium (2) = would need minor explanation; High (3) = would cause reputational damage if shared. Record score in Quick Check Matrix.

---

### Test 3: CEO Test

Frame the question directly: "Would the CEO of my firm approve this with the firm's name and reputation on it?"

**This test catches**:
- Overstatements that damage brand credibility
- Risky claims that expose the firm to liability
- Tone or framing that contradicts firm values
- Aggressive positioning that burns bridges

**Scoring**: Low (1) = CEO would approve without question; Medium (2) = would need brief justification; High (3) = CEO would reject or demand changes. Record score in Quick Check Matrix.

## High-Risk Language Patterns

Identify problematic language before it becomes a liability. Replace dangerous phrases using this table.

### Legal Risk Category

| Pattern | Risk | Before | After |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| "We guarantee..." | Creates contractual liability | "We guarantee a 20% ROI" | "We are aiming to deliver a 20% improvement" |
| "All X do..." | Invites counterexamples | "All enterprises struggle with data integration" | "Many enterprises we work with face data integration challenges" |
| "[Competitor] fails at..." | Defamation exposure | "Competitor X fails to scale" | "We differentiate through our scalability approach" |
| "We will never..." | Creates broken promise if circumstances change | "We will never share your data" | "We protect client data per [standard] and our contracts" |
| "This is the only way..." | False exclusivity | "The only way to transform is through our methodology" | "Our methodology has proven effective for transformation" |

### Credibility Risk Category

| Pattern | Risk | Before | After |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| "Studies show..." | Unverified claim | "Studies show digital transformation increases revenue" | "According to [specific source], X% report revenue improvements" |
| "Everyone knows..." | False consensus | "Everyone knows legacy systems block innovation" | "Many organisations we work with find legacy systems constraining" |
| "Obviously..." | False certainty | "It's obvious that outsourcing reduces costs" | "Cost reduction is a common benefit of strategic outsourcing" |
| "No one disputes..." | Ignores legitimate disagreement | "No one disputes AI's impact on jobs" | "There's significant debate about AI's workforce impact" |
| "[Anonymous] told me..." | Hearsay | "A CIO told me this approach doesn't work" | "In our experience, this approach requires..." |
| "As an expert in X..." | Authority claimed without verifiable credentials in the specific domain | "As an AI expert, I believe regulation is premature" | "Based on our work in [specific area], we observe that regulatory timing depends on [factors]" |
| "Data proves X" | Unqualified absolute claim; invites challenge | "Data proves digital transformation increases revenue" | "Available data suggests a positive correlation between digital transformation and revenue growth" |
| Qualifier-Creep | Starts narrow, ends universal; attentive readers notice the inflation | "In some cases, AI can improve efficiency... Therefore, AI will transform the industry" | Maintain consistent scope: "In some cases, AI can improve efficiency... These results suggest potential for broader application, pending further evidence" |

### Reputation Risk Category

| Pattern | Risk | Before | After |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| "Unlike our competitors..." | Attacks others; looks weak | "Unlike our competitors, we actually care about client outcomes" | "Our differentiator is our commitment to measurable outcomes" |
| "We fixed what [firm] broke..." | Implies competitor incompetence | "We fixed what the previous consultant broke" | "We're building on lessons learned and moving forward to..." |
| "Clients tell us we're..." | Self-praise through proxy | "Clients tell us we're the best in the industry" | "We've received recognition for our work in [area]" |
| "Only we can..." | Narrow, brittle claim | "Only we understand this industry" | "We bring deep expertise in this industry" |
| "Better than..." | Comparative weakness | "We're better than internal teams" | "We bring specialized capabilities your internal team lacks" |

### Logical Risk Category

| Pattern | Risk | Before | After |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| **False Dilemma** | Eliminates valid options; readers who see alternatives lose trust | "We either adopt AI now or fall behind permanently" | "Adopting AI early positions us competitively, though timing depends on readiness" |
| **Hasty Generalisation** | Universal claim from limited evidence; experts will challenge immediately | "Three clients reported issues, so the platform is unreliable" | "Some clients have reported issues, which warrants further investigation" |
| **False Causality** | Confuses correlation with causation; undermines analytical credibility | "We implemented the new process and revenue grew 15%" | "Revenue grew 15% during the period following implementation; further analysis is needed to isolate contributing factors" |
| **Non Sequitur** | Conclusion doesn't follow from evidence; signals weak reasoning | "Our team is highly experienced, so delivery risk is minimal" | "Our team's experience in [specific domain] helps mitigate [specific risk], though other factors also apply" |

**Auto-rewrite rule:** Each detected logical risk pattern MUST trigger a rewrite recommendation using the "After" column as a template. Present the original (higher risk) alongside the rewritten version (lower risk) and let the user choose.

## User Decision Protocol

The core innovation: Claude presents, user decides. When reputation risk is detected, follow this exact flow:

### Step 1: Flag the Risk

Identify the issue and severity. Use this format:

```
[RISK] REPUTATION RISK DETECTED

Issue: [Specific problem]
Severity: [Low/Medium/High]
Dimension: [Misinterpretation/Credibility/Legal/Reputation]
Reason: [Why this is risky]
```

### Step 2: Present Alternatives

Offer the original version alongside revised option(s):

```
OPTION A (Original - Higher Risk)
[Your original text]

OPTION B (Revised - Lower Risk)
[Professionally reframed version]

(Additional options if appropriate)
```

### Step 3: Explain the Trade-off

Be explicit about what changes:

```
Trade-off Analysis:
- Option A: [More direct/stronger language, but X risk]
- Option B: [Still conveys intent, but protects reputation by Y]
```

### Step 4: Ask for Direction

Give user agency. Use coded options for fast response:

```
R1: [Risk description]
  a) Accept original (higher risk) — [why user might choose this]
  b) Use revised version (lower risk) — [what changes]
  c) Rewrite approach entirely — [alternative framing]
  d) Escalate to human review

Reply with: R1: b (or your own answer)
```

When multiple risks are flagged, number them sequentially (R1, R2, R3...) so the user can respond in a single line:
```
Reply with: R1: b, R2: a, R3: c
```

**Wait for explicit user response.** Do not assume; present the choice.

## Example: User Decision Protocol in Action

**Situation**: User drafts a statement about a competitor.

**Detection**:
```
[RISK] REPUTATION RISK DETECTED

Issue: Statement compares to competitor; implies weakness
Severity: High
Dimension: Reputation/Credibility
Reason: Attacking competitors signals insecurity and damages your credibility more than theirs
```

**Presentation**:
```
OPTION A (Original)
"Unlike our competitors, we actually invest in client success rather than just selling deals."

OPTION B (Revised)
"Our model emphasizes long-term client outcomes. We measure success by your business results."

Trade-off:
- Option A: More pointed; directly contrasts with competitors
- Option B: Still positions you positively; avoids comparative attack
```

**Decision Request**:
```
R1: Competitor comparison — implies weakness
  a) Accept original — sharper competitive positioning
  b) Use revised — removes competitor reference; keeps value proposition clear
  c) Rewrite — "Here's what makes our engagement model different..." [new angle]
  d) Escalate to human review

Reply with: R1: b (or your own answer)
```

## Escalation Rules

Flag for human expert review (legal, PR, or leadership) when ANY of these conditions exist:

- [ ] **Legal exposure**: Language that could be interpreted as guarantees, warranties, or defamation
- [ ] **Public/permanent**: Posting to social media, publishing in articles, or making recorded statements
- [ ] **Client-facing**: Formal proposals, contracts, or communications that create legal obligations
- [ ] **Sensitive topics**: Statements about competitors, regulatory issues, or controversial subjects
- [ ] **High stakes**: Communication affecting major contracts, partnerships, or firm reputation
- [ ] **Unclear precedent**: No prior approval for this type of statement in your firm
- [ ] **Multiple audiences**: Message will be seen by clients, partners, employees, and public
- [ ] **Contradicts firm messaging**: Conflicts with established brand position or prior communications
- [ ] **Media involvement**: Any communication that could reach journalists or industry influencers
- [ ] **Personal/firm separation unclear**: Your personal views and firm positions are blurred

**Escalation Template**:
```
FLAGGED FOR EXPERT REVIEW

Type: [Legal/PR/Leadership]
Reason: [Which escalation rule applies]
Draft: [Full text]
Concern: [Specific risk]
Timeline: [When decision needed]
```
