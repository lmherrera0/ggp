## The Unwritten Cultural Rules of Professional Services

---

## Core Principle

**Your personal reputation IS your firm's reputation.**

Every interaction, every communication, every decision reflects not just on you but on the entire consulting organisation you represent. Professional services is built on trust. Breach it once publicly, and recovery takes years.

## The 7 Golden Rules

### 1. Never Speak Ill

**Rule**: Do not criticize competitors, vendors, or other professionals publicly or in contexts where it could be repeated.

**Why**: Competitive criticism damages your credibility more than the target's. It signals insecurity and unprofessionalism.

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| "Competitor X is weak at data strategy" | "Our strength is in data-driven decision frameworks" |
| "That firm's analysis was flawed" | "We bring a different methodology to this challenge" |
| "Their consultant didn't understand the business" | "We focus on deep stakeholder engagement" |
| "They're just selling snake oil" | "We believe in sustainable, measurable outcomes" |

---

### 2. Never Complain

**Rule**: Reframe problems, obstacles, and setbacks as opportunities or learning moments.

**Why**: Consulting is about solutions. Complaining signals you lack agency. Clients hire solvers, not people who blame circumstances.

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| "The client won't engage with the process" | "This is an opportunity to strengthen our change management approach" |
| "The data quality is terrible" | "We're identifying data governance improvements upfront" |
| "They keep rejecting our recommendations" | "We're refining our recommendations to address underlying concerns" |
| "The timeline is impossible" | "This timeline challenges us to prioritise high-impact work first" |

---

### 3. Never Compromise Clients

**Rule**: Client confidentiality is sacred. It survives the end of the engagement.

**Why**: Your only leverage in a competitive industry is the trust clients place in you. One breach destroys your reputation permanently.

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Share client examples without explicit written permission | When referencing work, use anonymized or fully disclosed examples |
| Discuss client struggles in casual conversation | "I've seen this challenge across industries I work in..." |
| Use client names in case studies without signed agreements | Require formal case study rights; compensate if using their story |
| Mention client information on social media | Keep social posts about work generic and professional |
| Discuss client politics with other clients | Maintain strict information barriers between clients |

---

### 4. Protect the Brand

**Rule**: You represent your firm 24/7, including personal social media and outside commitments.

**Why**: Digital footprint is permanent. Clients research principals before engaging. One controversial post can disqualify a contract.

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Post political rants on personal social media | Share thoughtful industry perspectives and expertise |
| Criticize the firm's decisions publicly | Raise concerns internally; support publicly |
| Engage in flame wars online | Disengage from heated discussions gracefully |
| Dress casually in public forums where clients might see | Maintain professional appearance in any client-facing context |
| Make controversial statements while identified as firm member | Use personal social media cautiously; separate professional identity |

---

### 5. Client is Always Right (Publicly)

**Rule**: Keep disagreements private. Public communications must always reflect alignment with the client.

**Why**: Your credibility depends on presenting a united front. Client questions about your commitment will be answered by whether you publicly challenge them.

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| "The client rejected our recommendation" (public) | In private debrief: discuss why client chose alternative path |
| Post about client changes you disagree with | If asked publicly: "We're supporting their strategic direction" |
| Express doubt about client viability | Internally: assess and flag risks; externally: committed partner |
| Correct client in public forums | Private conversation: "Here's an alternative perspective for you to consider" |

---

### 6. Never Burn Bridges

**Rule**: Every person you work with today could become a client, partner, or advocate tomorrow.

**Why**: Professional circles are smaller than you think. Your behaviour toward "unimportant" people becomes reputation data.

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Act dismissive toward junior staff at other firms | Treat everyone as a potential future peer or leader |
| Refuse to help a competitor in need | Build reciprocal professional relationships |
| Publicly criticize a vendor you fired | "We made a different choice for our current needs" |
| Burn out a junior colleague and avoid them later | Invest in people; stay in touch with former teammates |

---

### 7. Compete with Class

**Rule**: Win on merit, knowledge, and delivery quality. Never resort to undermining others.

**Why**: The consulting industry is built on repeat business and referrals. Players who win through integrity outlast those who win through manipulation.

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Undercut competitor pricing to win a deal | Emphasize unique value; let price reflect quality |
| Spread rumors about competing proposals | Let your work speak; focus on your strengths |
| Poach client relationships aggressively | Build relationships professionally; let clients come to you |
| Exploit a competitor's client issue | Offer genuine help; if they hire you later, that's earned trust |

---

## Language Reframing

Convert dangerous internal thoughts into professional communication. These phrases prevent misinterpretation and preserve relationships.

| Dangerous Phrase | Professional Alternative |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| "The process is broken" | "There are optimisation opportunities in this workflow" |
| "This is chaos" | "There's complexity here we can help structure" |
| "They failed to deliver" | "There were delivery challenges we can help address" |
| "The client is wrong" | "There may be an alternative perspective worth exploring" |
| "Our competitor is weak at X" | "We differentiate by excellence in X" |
| "We guarantee results" | "We are committed to delivering measurable value" |
| "They don't understand their business" | "This is an opportunity to build deeper operational understanding" |
| "That idea won't work" | "Here are factors to consider before implementation" |
| "They're being unreasonable" | "Let's understand what's driving this perspective" |
| "Management is incompetent" | "There are capability gaps we can help fill" |

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Asked to Criticize a Competitor

**Situation**: A prospect asks, "Why should we choose you over Firm X? They're struggling with X, right?"

**Response Template**:
- **Acknowledge**: "I respect Firm X; they do solid work in [area]."
- **Redirect**: "What we focus on is [your differentiator]. Here's how we'd approach your situation..."
- **Close professionally**: "I'm confident our approach is the right fit for you. Let's focus on what matters most to your business."

**Why it works**: You refuse the trap, acknowledge the competitor respectfully, and own the conversation.

---

### Scenario 2: Client Project Went Wrong

**Situation**: A key deliverable missed deadline or quality standards fell short.

**Response Template**:
- **Own immediately**: "We didn't hit our commitment. Here's what happened and why."
- **Remediate**: "Here's how we're fixing it and preventing recurrence."
- **Rebuild trust**: "You can hold us accountable to [specific new standard/timeline/check-in]."
- **Never blame the client**: Internal analysis can show where client behaviour contributed; client conversation must own your role.

**Why it works**: Ownership rebuilds trust faster than deflection. Clients expect perfection; they respect accountability.

---

### Scenario 3: Vendor Underperformed

**Situation**: A subcontractor or partner failed to meet expectations, affecting delivery.

**Response Template**:
- **Take responsibility**: "We selected this vendor and are responsible for their performance."
- **Take action**: "We're immediately [replacing/restructuring/adding oversight]."
- **Discreet vendor management**: Vendor conversation happens privately; client hears only your solution.
- **Never trash the vendor publicly**: Future projects may require this vendor; other firms may know them.

**Why it works**: Client sees your quality control and accountability. Vendor remains viable for future use.

---

### Scenario 4: Internal Conflict Goes Public

**Situation**: A team member or partner disagrees with your approach publicly or in front of a client.

**Response Template**:
- **In the moment**: Don't escalate. "That's a fair point. Let's discuss offline and come back with aligned recommendation."
- **After meeting**: Private conversation: understand perspective, align on messaging, determine how to move forward.
- **Moving forward**: Present unified approach; any internal disagreement stays internal.
- **Never undermine publicly**: You may have been wrong. Acknowledge privately; move forward professionally.

**Why it works**: Unified teams win contracts. Visible conflict loses them.

## Etiquette Checklist

Before any external communication or action, verify:

- [ ] **Confidentiality Check**: Does this expose any client information? (Even anonymized, are there identifying details?)
- [ ] **Tone Check**: Could this be misinterpreted as criticism, complaint, or self-interest?
- [ ] **Attribution Check**: Can I name my sources and link to evidence, or am I relying on hearsay?
- [ ] **Competitor Check**: Am I comparing ourselves on merit, or am I criticizing competitors?
- [ ] **Client Check**: Does this reflect alignment with my clients, or visible disagreement?
- [ ] **Screenshot Test**: If this were captured and shared widely without context, would I still be comfortable with it? (If no, revise it.)
