**Path from SKILL.md**: `examples/[channel]/`
**Path from this file**: `[channel]/`

## Rules

1. **Channel-specific only**: Read examples from the folder matching your target channel. Do NOT read other channels.
2. **Extract, don't copy**: Learn patterns to apply, not text to plagiarise.
3. **GGP overrides**: If an example conflicts with GGP rules (unverified claims, missing sources), follow GGP. Style is learned; compliance is non-negotiable.

## Extraction Checklist

For each example read, extract:

| Dimension | What to Look For |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Tone** | Formal vs conversational, warmth level, humour usage, directness |
| **Structure** | Opening pattern (hook, question, stat?), section flow, closing style |
| **Length** | Word count range, paragraph length, sentence length |
| **Vocabulary** | Recurring terms, preferred phrasing, technical depth level |
| **Opening patterns** | How the author starts — personal anecdote, data point, provocative question, direct statement |
| **CTA style** | How the author closes — question to audience, resource link, reflection, call to action |
| **Formatting** | Use of bullet points, headers, emojis, line breaks, whitespace |
| **Voice markers** | First person vs third, active vs passive, contractions usage |

## Return Protocol

After extracting patterns:

1. Summarise learned patterns internally (do NOT output to user)
2. **RETURN to SKILL.md** — continue with Phase 3 (Create + Validate + Deliver)
3. Apply learned patterns during content creation (step 3e)
4. Learned style informs HOW you write; GGP rules govern WHAT you can write

**Flow**: SKILL.md Phase 2/C -> _style-learning.md -> examples/[channel]/ -> **RETURN to SKILL.md** -> Create + Validate + Deliver

**NEVER stay in the examples folder. NEVER skip validation after learning.**
