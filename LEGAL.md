The Grounded Gate Protocol (GGP), including all associated documentation, methodologies, visual marker systems, iteration control mechanisms, and platform-specific adaptations, is the original intellectual work of Liz Magaly Herrera Jara (“the Author”).

### Personal Intellectual Property Declaration

This framework is the Author’s personal intellectual property. It was conceived, designed, and developed independently, outside the scope of any employment relationship, using the Author’s own resources and on the Author’s own time. No employer, client, or third party has ownership rights, claims, or licensing authority over this work unless explicitly granted in writing by the Author.

The hosting, storage, or display of this framework on any platform (including employer-provided infrastructure, cloud services, or third-party repositories) does not transfer, assign, or imply any ownership rights to the platform operator, employer, or service provider.

### Transparency Statement: AI-Assisted Creation

In the spirit of the very principles this framework promotes, full transparency is provided regarding its creation:

This framework was developed collaboratively between the Author and Anthropic’s Claude AI models. The AI assisted with research synthesis and compilation, document structuring and formatting, platform-specific adaptation drafting, and technical documentation generation.

**The following remain entirely the Author’s original contributions:**

**Tier A — Core Inventions (Highest IP Value)**

1. The “GroundedGate Protocol” concept, naming, and acronym (GGP)
2. The five-marker confidence classification system: [CONFIRMED], [GAP], [INFERENCE], [UNVERIFIED], [RISK]
3. The four-tier source classification hierarchy (Tier 1–4) and source citation metadata format
4. The anti-fatigue iteration control mechanism with structured round limits
5. The Devil’s Advocate risk assessment framework and its three tests (Hostile Reader Test, Screenshot Test, CEO Test)

**Tier B — Structural Architecture & Methodologies**

6. The 14-phase GGP compliance cycle (Phases A–N) with zero-skip policy
7. The 22-channel communication system with dedicated templates (Email, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, Presentations, Press Release, Academic Journal, Legal Disclaimers, and 14 others)
8. The 7-analysis template library (Use Cases, Benchmark, Gap Analysis, SWOT, Cost-Benefit, Maturity Assessment, Stakeholder Analysis)
9. The chain-of-thought reasoning gate and pre-creation compliance verification (12-point gate)
10. The post-creation validation gate (11-point checklist)
11. The platform-specific implementation guides (Claude, ChatGPT, Google Gems, Copilot)
12. The consulting etiquette framework (“The 7 Golden Rules”) and prohibited language patterns database

**Tier C — Integration & Ecosystem Design**

13. The cross-compliance integration architecture between GGP and the Author’s Brand Voice & Visual Gate (BVVG) system
14. The sequential skill pipeline design: Primary Research → Secondary Research → Content Creation → Editorial Publishing, with bi-directional feedback loops
15. The content atomisation framework (one research output producing 11+ derivative formats)
16. The inter-skill data handoff protocol and error recovery cascading failure protocol
17. The Hero’s Journey academic narrative framework (5-act structure for research writing)
18. The 6-layer editorial review stack with severity classification and feedback loop triggers

**Tier D — Strategic Direction & Professional Application**

19. All practical application requirements derived from the Author’s real-world professional experience in data governance, analytics, and AI-assisted communications
20. All strategic decisions regarding framework architecture, versioning, and evolution
21. The domain-specific verification rules for financial, statistical, and business intelligence content
22. Final review, validation, and approval of all content across all versions

The Author takes full responsibility for the intellectual direction, practical utility, and professional applicability of this framework and all associated systems.

## Data Protection & Privacy

The GGP framework itself does not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal data. It is a methodology document, not a software application.
