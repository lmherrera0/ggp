### Personal Intellectual Property Declaration

This framework is the Author’s personal intellectual property. It was conceived, designed, and developed independently, outside the scope of any employment relationship, using the Author’s own resources and on the Author’s own time. No employer, client, or third party has ownership rights, claims, or licensing authority over this work unless explicitly granted in writing by the Author.

The hosting, storage, or display of this framework on any platform (including employer-provided infrastructure, cloud services, or third-party repositories) does not transfer, assign, or imply any ownership rights to the platform operator, employer, or service provider.

### Transparency Statement: AI-Assisted Creation

In the spirit of the very principles this framework promotes, full transparency is provided regarding its creation:

This framework was developed collaboratively between the Author and Anthropic’s Claude AI models. The AI assisted with research synthesis and compilation, document structuring and formatting, platform-specific adaptation drafting, and technical documentation generation.

**[CONFIRMED] The following remain entirely the Author’s original contributions:**

- The core conceptual framework and methodology
- The “GroundedGate” naming and branding
- The visual marker system design decisions
- The anti-fatigue iteration control concept
- The practical application requirements derived from real-world professional experience
- All strategic decisions regarding framework architecture
- Final review, validation, and approval of all content

The Author takes full responsibility for the intellectual direction, practical utility, and professional applicability of this framework.
